 1Introduction 
 
Purpose and Scope 
  This handbook describes the DOE General Employee 
Radiological Training program.  It includes standards and policies as well as recommendations for material development and program administration.  It is intended for use by DOE contractors for the development of facility-specific general 
employee radiological training. 
 
Compliance with 10 CFR 835-Subpart J 
 
The DOE core training materials for General Employee 
Radiological Training (GERT) reflect the requirements 
identified in 10 CFR 835-Subpart J, Radiation Safety Training  
and recommendations identified in chapter 14, Radiation Safety Training, of the DOE Implementation Guide G44.1B, 
Radiation Protection Programs Guide , and in the DOE 
Radiological Control Standard [DOE-STD-1098-99, Ch. 1].  
When implemented in its entirety and supplemented as noted with appropriate facility-specific information, this handbook is an acceptable method to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 
835-Subpart J for general employee radiological training.  
However, it is incumbent on management of each facility to review the content of this handbook against the radiological hazards present to ensure that the training content is appropriate to each individual’s prior training, work 
assignments, and degree of exposure to potential radiological 
hazards. 
 
Training described in this handbook does not eliminate the need for additional training for facility-specific hazards.  Notations throughout the program documents indicate the 
need for facility-specific information.  If the noted section is not 
applicable to the facility, no information is required to be presented.  The site Radiological Control Manager or designee should concur in facility-generated radiological training material.

Goal of Training Program 
 
 The goal of the core training program is to provide a sufficient 
level of knowledge and skills in radiological fundamentals  commensurate with the assigned duties and potential radiological hazards encountered as a general employee at DOE facilities using or possessing radioactive materials and/or radiation-producing devices. 
 
Organizational Relationships and Reporting Structure 
 
 
1.  The DOE Office of Worker Safety and Health Policy 
(DOE HS-11) is responsible for approving and 
maintaining the core training materials associated with 
the GERT program. 
 
 2.      The establishment of a comprehensive and effective 
contractor site radiological control training program is the 
responsibility of line management and their subordinates.  
The training function may be performed by a separate training organization, but the responsibility for quality and effectiveness rests with line management. 
 
 
 
    
 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 3Training Program Description 
 Overview of Training Program 
 
General Employee Radiological Training (GERT) is provided 
to all site employees who receive occupational exposure during access to controlled areas (as defined in 10 CFR 835.2(a)) at a DOE site or facility or who are permitted unescorted access to controlled areas.  These individuals may 
routinely enter the controlled areas and encounter radiological 
barriers, postings, radiation producing devices or radioactive materials.  Employee responsibilities for observing and obeying radiological postings and procedures are emphasized throughout this training. 
 
• Additional training beyond GERT is required for employees 
who are identified as radiological workers.  Every 
employee, both radiological worker and non-radiological worker, must play an active part in maintaining exposures to radiation and radioactive materials within DOE limits and As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). 
 
• GERT qualified individuals should be able to place the 
risks associated with working at a nuclear facility in 
perspective with other risks that we take in our everyday life. 
 
Description of Programs 
 
GERT Core Academic Material is approximately 1 hour in 
length, but will vary dependent upon the amount of facility-specific material. 
 
GERT Core Academic Training includes the following: 
 
Sources of Radiation, Non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation, Risks in Perspective, Radiological Controls, Monitoring (Dosimetry), Emergency Procedures, ALARA Program, Employee Responsibilities, and Exposure Reports.  
 
 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 4Proficiency Requirements 
 
In accordance with 10 CFR 835-Subpart J, each individual shall complete training on the topics established in 10 CFR 
835-Subpart J, commensurate with the hazards in the area and required controls, prior to being permitted unescorted access to controlled areas and prior to receiving occupational exposure during access to controlled areas at a DOE site or facility.  An examination or performance demonstration is not 
required for training to meet 10 CFR 835.901(a) requirements. 
 
Retraining 
 
In accordance with 10 CFR 835-Subpart J, training shall be provided to individuals when there is a significant change to 
radiation protection policies and procedures that may affect the individual and at intervals not to exceed 24 months.  Training should include selected fundamentals of the initial 
training with emphasis on seldom-used knowledge and skills.   
Training should be tailored to subjects for which trainee evaluations and experience indicate that special emphasis and depth of coverage is needed.  A self-study method may be used, when possible, for 
retraining.  The self-study method should allow workers to 
review the training material followed by a presentation of any updates, facility changes and lessons learned, etc.    DOE recommends that, in the alternate year when training is 
not required, the GERT handbook be provided to general 
employees with any updates, facility changes and lessons learned.  Materials developed in support of training should be documented in accordance with 10 CFR 835.704 
“Administrative Records.” 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 5Instructor Training and Qualifications 
 
All classroom instruction should be provided by instructors qualified in accordance with the contractor’s site instructor 
qualification program.  Training staff (contractor and subcontractor, if used) should possess both technical knowledge and experience, and the developmental and instructional skills required to fulfill their assigned duties. 
 
1. Training staff responsible for program management, 
supervision, and development should have and maintain the education, experience, and technical qualifications required for their jobs. 
 
2. Instructors should have the technical qualifications,  
including adequate theory, practical knowledge, and experience, for the subject matter that they are assigned to teach. 
 
3. Methods should be in place at each contractor site to 
ensure that individual instructors meet and maintain position qualification requirements. 
 
4. Subject matter experts without instructor qualification may 
provide training in their area of expertise.  However, if 
these subject matter experts are to be permanent 
instructors, they should be trained as instructors in the next practical training cycle. 
 DOE Order 5480.20A, “Personnel Selection, Qualification, and 
Training Requirements for DOE Nuclear Facilities,” discusses 
qualification requirements for instructors. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 6Training Program Material Development 
 
Training Material Presentation 
 
Training materials for the core programs consist of lesson 
plans and study guides.  To ensure compliance with 10 CFR 835-Subpart J, facility-specific materials must be added to the core materials when necessary to adequately train individuals for facility-specific radiological hazards. 
 
Training Certificates 
 
A training certificate that identifies the individual’s current 
training status may be provided to qualified personnel.  Each 
facility is responsible for administering and tracking the 
certificates.  Facilities have the option of utilizing the certificates as proof of training.  However, it should be noted that 10 CFR 835-Subpart J 
requires each facility to ensure general employees have 
adequate training for the hazards present.  The training certificate from another DOE site does not, in itself, relieve the facility from ensuring the worker has had adequate training. It is appropriate for facilities to supplement a visiting employee’s training with facility-specific training sufficient to 
ensure an adequate level of training for the hazards present. 
 
Training Aids, References 
 
Facility-specific training aids may be developed at the facility to suit individual training styles.  Each facility may add 
information, activities, and/or view graphs to enhance the program. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 7Training Program Standards and Policies 
 Lectures, Seminars, Training Exercises, etc. 
 
GERT core training programs are designed to be delivered in 
a classroom setting.  An alternate delivery method may be implemented with computer-based training (CBT) equipment or web-based training (WBT) equipment.  The presentation of GERT should include core materials and facility-specific 
information and lessons learned.   
 
Delinquent Training/Failure Procedures and Policies 
 
General employees who are delinquent on retraining shall lose their status of having unescorted access to controlled areas 
until successful completion of the delinquent training requirement.  
Exceptions and Waivers 
 
Successful completion of the core course for GERT training at 
one DOE site may be recognized by other DOE sites.  However, the determination as to the adequacy of training as required by 10 CFR 835-Subpart J is the responsibility of the facility in which the general employee will have access to, or 
receive occupational exposure in, controlled areas. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 8Administration 
 Training Records 
 
Training records and course documentation shall meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR 835.704 “Administrative Records” and be in accordance with local DOE Records Disposition Schedules.  
Training Program Development/Change Requests  
All requests for program changes and revisions should be 
submitted using the DOE Technical Standard Program form “Document Improvement Propos al” F 1300.3. This form is 
available from the DOE Technical Standards Home Page - 
Maintenance of DOE Technical Standards (TSPP-09).  See the Foreword of this document for website address.  
Audits (internal and external) 
 
Internal verification of training effectiveness may be 
accomplished through senior instructor or supervisor observation of practical applications and discussions of course material.  Results should be documented and maintained by the organization responsible for Radiological Control Training. 
The GERT core training program materials and processes will 
be evaluated on a periodic basis by DOE-HQ.  The evaluation should include a comparison of program elements with applicable industry standards and requirements.  
Evaluating Training Program Effectiveness  
Verification of the effectiveness of Radiological Control training 
should be accomplished by surveying a limited subset of former students in the workplace.  This evaluation should include observation of practical applications and discussion of 
the course material, and may include an associated written 
examination.  DOE/HS has issued guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of radiological training through the DOE Operations Offices and DOE Field Offices.  These guidelines are included as an attachment to this Program Management 
Guide. 
 For additional guidance, refer to DOE STD 1070-94, “Guide for Evaluation of Nuclear Facility Training Programs.”  The guidelines contained in these documents are relevant for the establishment and implementation of post-training evaluation 
and retention testing programs. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 9In response to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board 
(DNFSB) Recommendation 91-6, DOE committed to develop an implementation plan to upgrade radiation protection 
programs at DOE defense nuclear facilities. 
 The implementation plan detailed DOE’s plans to develop and implement radiation protection post-training evaluation and retention testing programs.  Post-training evaluations will be used to identify opportunities for improving course materials 
and instruction methods and techniques and the need for 
additional training.  Retention testing will indicate when individual performance or testing fails to meet expectations.  Corrective actions for deficiencies identified in retention testing will be incorporated in the individual’s development plan and 
the site’s training program on an appropriate schedule. 
 In addition, Article 613.7 of the DOE Radiological Control Standard states that sites should implement a training effectiveness verification program.  This program, which is in 
addition to performance evaluations routinely performed by the 
site’s training department, is to verify the effectiveness of radiological control training by surveying a limited subset of former students in the workplace.  This recommendation applies to both DOE defense nuclear facilities and DOE facilities not classified as defense nuclear facilities. 
Per DOE’s commitment to the DNFSB, it is expected that all 
defense nuclear facilities will implement these or equivalent programs.  DOE facilities not classified as defense nuclear facilities should also strive to implement such programs.  Line management should monitor progress of program 
implementation. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 10The guidance provided in DOE STD-1070-94 is not meant to 
be prescriptive.  Training organizations should review this guidance and determine its applicability, taking into 
consideration the existence of similar programs already in 
place at their facilities.

 I. INTRODUCTION  
 
In response to Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) 
Recommendation 91-6, DOE developed the following guidelines to support 
efforts to upgrade the Department’s radiation protection programs.  These guidelines support implementation of the U.S. Department of Energy “Radiological Control Standard," Article 613.7 (1999). 
 
A. Purpose
  
 
The purpose of a training program and it s associated evaluation phase is to 
assure that workers are qualified to perform their jobs competently and safely.  This purpose should be kept foremost while establishing the procedural controls of the post-training evaluation process at each site. 
 
The purpose of this document is to aid DOE sites in developing procedures and practices for conducting post-training evaluation and retention testing of the following core radiological control training courses:  GERT, RW, and RCT training.  Similar procedures and practices should be applied to post-training evaluation and retention testing of the supplemental radiological 
control training courses. 
 
A retention testing program differs from a post-training evaluation program in the usage of its results.  The results of a retention testing program are used to assist in:  (1) identifying when individual performance fails to meet expectations; (2) identifying adverse trends in radiological performance; and 
(3) correcting individual performance deficiencies.  The results of a post-
training evaluation program are directed towards improving the training program rather than correcting individual performance deficiencies. 
 
This document provides guidance on the issues and practices that should be 
considered in setting up such programs.  It is not intended to prescribe 
specific practices that must be followed by all sites. 
 
The diversity of conditions among the various DOE sites will require that the application of good practices recommended in this guideline may differ from site to site.  That diversity includes the nature of the training organization, 
the nature of the trainees, the number of trainees, and the frequency in 
which the trainees will apply the training.  
 
The conduct of evaluations will require that evaluators be trained at each site.  In particular, the consistency with which any set of evaluators will rate 
the skill and knowledge levels of the former trainees will need to be 
emphasized.  It is essential that the judgment of skill levels not vary 
appreciably from one evaluator to the next.  The expertise needed to conduct such training may be available at the site or may be acquired from offsite sources.  Several written references are provided. 
 
The results of post-training evaluations may be used to upgrade core course materials as described in the Program Management Guides. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-2 
 B.     Purpose of Post-Training Evaluation and Retention Testing  
    
     Post-training evaluation has four primary purposes: 
 
1.  To measure the retention of skills and knowledge provided during 
training for extended periods following the training; 
2. To measure the degree to which the training is used on the job; 3. To provide feedback to improve the training; and 4. To measure the cost effectiveness of the training. 
 
A primary purpose of retention testing is to incorporate corrective actions into individual development plans based on deficiencies observed during the retention testing process. 
 
C.  Assumptions
  
 
1. These guidelines will be specific to evaluation of the radiological control 
training contained in the core training materials. 
2. The applications of these guidelines will be unique for each DOE site. 
3. Each DOE site will formalize its Radiological Safety Training Post-
Training Evaluation Program and Retention Testing Program in site procedures. 
4. These guidelines summarize the requirements of other documents, 
which explain more fully the process of training evaluation.  
5. These guidelines are sufficient for knowledgeable individuals to use to 
create site controlling procedures. 
6. Personnel engaged in post-training evaluation or retention testing will 
require some training or previous evaluation experience. 
7. Individual sites may choose to include this evaluation program as part of 
site-wide evaluation of training. 
8. Other radiological control training may be considered for evaluation 
along with core training. 
9. The phrase "in the workplace" in the RCS cited below is taken 
figuratively to mean at the work location.  While observation of skills would be preferable while engaged in real work at the actual workplace, the discussion of content may or may not be best done at that location.  
Written testing would be best done in a classroom setting where quiet 
and privacy may be maintained. 
 
D. Guidance From DOE-STD-1070-94
  
 
DOE-STD-1070-94, "Guidelines for Evaluation of Nuclear Facility Training 
Programs," appendix, objective 8.0, "Training Program Evaluation," contains seven criteria.  Three of these criteria are applicable to the purpose of these guidelines: 
 
Criteria 8.1: A comprehensive evaluation of individual training programs 
is conducted by qualified individuals on a periodic basis to 
identify program strengths and weaknesses. 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-3 
  Criteria 8.3: Feedback from trainee performance during training is used         
to evaluate and refine the training program.  Feedback from former trainees and their supervisors is used to 
evaluate and refine the training program. 
 
Criteria 8.5: Improvements and changes to initial and continuing 
training are systematically initiated, evaluated, tracked, and incorporated to track training deficiencies and performance problems. 
 
E. DOE RCS, Article 613.7
  
 
Article 613.7 states: 
 
Verification of the effectiveness of radiological control training should be 
accomplished by surveying a limited subset of former students in the workplace.  This verification is in addition to performance evaluations routinely performed by training departments.  This evaluation should include observation of practical applications and discussions of the course material 
and may include written examinations.  The survey should be performed by 
radiological control managers and supervisors, quality assurance personnel, or senior instructors after the former student has had the opportunity to perform work for several months.  The results should be documented. 
 
F. Elements of Article 613.7  
 
The following elements are stated: 
 
1. The purpose of the evaluation is to verify the effectiveness of radiological 
control training. 
2. The survey should be made on a subset of students several months after 
the training. 
3. The survey may be conducted by training or nontraining personnel. 4. The survey should be conducted at the workplace. 5. The survey should be conducted in addition to any evaluations made as 
part of the training process. 
6. The survey should consist of: 
   -  Observation of practical applications of the training; 
   -  Discussion of the course material with the trainee; and    -  An optional written examination, as appropriate, to measure retention. 
7. The results should be documented. 
 
G. Qualifications of Evaluators
 
 
Personnel who perform the evaluations should be technical experts on radiological control practices and should possess, or be trained to develop, interviewing skills and observational skills. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-4 
  
 
H. Correlation Between Evaluation and Training   
 
The radiological control core training courses are nationally standardized.  Any changes to the training materials, including the test banks, should be correlated by training oversight groups.  How that correlation will be conducted is described in the program management guides for the courses.  
Site specific radiological control training may be evaluated and revised by 
that site.  
 
I. Training Requirements Based on Employee Duties
 
 
Table 3-1 of the RCS displays the types of workers and the recommended 
level of radiological training. 
 
J. Stakeholder Consensus   
 
Effective evaluation of training can only be conducted in a climate of 
consensus by all stakeholders.  An essential element in the evaluation process is the development of consensus in advance of the evaluation.  This involves agreement on the objectives of the evaluation, methods of evaluation to be used, and the required level of support that can be provided.  Agreement should also be reached on whether the evaluation 
process will undergo the same approval cycle as that of other training 
materials.   
 
Note that it may not be possible to obtain the same level of consensus in the development of a retention testing progr am, as the results of this program 
are used to provide remedial training for individuals exhibiting performance 
deficiencies.  The retention testing program must be conducted in a manner that eliminates questions as to the fairness and unbiased manner in which the program is implemented.  
 
K. A Checklist for Establishing and Implementing a Post-Training Evaluation 
Program   
 
The following steps are essential in formalizing the post-training evaluation process and should be considered in developing site procedures: 
 
1. Formalization via procedures of radiological control post-training 
evaluation; 
2. Establishment of evaluation goals, objectives, and schedule, including 
building consensus among stakeholders; 
3. Qualification of evaluators; 4. Preparation of evaluation materials; 
5. Conduct of evaluations; 
6. Reporting evaluation results; and 7. Program revision as applicable. 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-5 
 Note that this checklist is also applicable to a retention testing program. 
  
II. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION  
 
A. Schedules For Conducting Post-Training Evaluation and Retention Testing
  
 
DOE suggests that, based on predicted proficiencies, post-training evaluation be scheduled 3 to 6 months following the training. Conducting the 
evaluation at least 3 months following the training would provide an 
opportunity for the trainee to have used the skills on the job.  Site specific conditions may make it desirable to extend the period between training and evaluation, but data to support the extension decision should be collected to assure that the purposes of the evaluation are being met. 
 
Note that this schedule is also applicable to a retention testing program.  
B. Sample Sizes
  
 
The subset of former students to be sampled should be large enough to 
provide valid and reliable data for meeting the needs of the training and radiological control organizations.  The number selected to be evaluated depends on the degree of precision and reliability desired. 
 
Individuals to be evaluated should be selected using random number tables 
or some other randomizing technique unless the population size is so small 
that the randomizing effort will be of no value. 
 
Table 1 is a matrix that describes a suggested level of sample size that can provide an appropriate level of comfort and can be used to establish the 
sample sizes to be used at each site.  The percentages are based on the 
information provided in Dr. N.M. Dixon's "Evaluations:  A Tool for HRD 
Quality ." 
 
Note that these sample size guidelines also apply to a retention testing program. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

C.  Interpreting Results  
 
Interpretation of results should be based on the original purpose(s) for 
conducting the evaluation.  Interpretations can be centered on questions to be asked of the data.  Table 2 shows samples of the type of questions that could be asked for each of the four purposes for evaluating training. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

III.  GUIDELINES FOR COURSE POST-TRAINING EVALUATION  AND 
RETENTION TESTING  
 
A. General Instructions   
 
It may be beneficial and appropriate at some sites to combine in-field 
practical exams with training content discussions.  Thus, the observer can 
pose the identified questions while observing actual work being performed. 
 
1. In-Field Observation:  
 
Five skill areas could be included in in-field observations:  prejob 
preparations, knowledge level, r adiological practices, emergency 
response practices, and exit practices.  A checklist could be developed using a weighted point value system and identifying critical DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-9 
 practices.  The checklist could be modified to fit individual site 
requirements. 
 
2. Discussion Questions:  
 
Discussion with employees should determine whether the knowledge acquired in the training has been transferred to the job.  The intent is not simply to measure retention of specific facts.  The depth of the discussion would be directly correlated to the level of radiological hazard that may be encountered on the job. 
 
3. Written Exam: 
 
Written exams for evaluation of training effectiveness are optional. 
 
These written exams may test retention of specific content from the 
courses.  It may be desirable to use written tests that measure the ability to apply the knowledge from the training.  In that instance, questions could be developed to measure student reaction to case studies.  Such case study questions would allow each site to tailor the 
testing to its particular facilities, procedures, practices, and conditions. 
 
B. GERT
  
 
1. In-Field Observation:  
 
Some sites may desire to survey GERT trainees to determine their 
knowledge of hazardous areas to avoid.  Awareness drills, such as placing mock radioactive material in an unauthorized location to assess responses are also effective. 
 
2. Discussion Questions:  
 
GERT trained employees access controlled areas.  They should be aware of the hazards they may face in an emergency and how they should respond to those hazards.  The following questions may be part of the discussion: 
 
a. How many millirem of whole body dose do you normally receive 
on your job in a year? 
b. What is your annual whole body  dose limit; administrative dose 
guideline; when was the last time it was reported? 
c. What types of radiation hazards exist at your facility? 
d. How do you practice As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) 
techniques in your work? 
e. What are the sounds of the emergency alarms for your 
workplace? 
f. How are employees at your work area warned of radiation 
hazards? 
g. What obligations do you have to maintain exposure to radiation 
ALARA? DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 A-10 
 h. What is dosimetry and what precautions should be taken when 
handling dosimeters? 
  i. What radiological training are you required to take?  How does 
your training relate to your job? 
 
3. Written Exam:  
 
GERT trained employees are not required to pass a written examination. 
 
C. RW I
  
 
1. In-Field Observation:  
 
Table 3 is a sample chart that illustrates the in-field activities and 
weighting system that could be used to observe RW I trainees.  The 
numbers shown are based on conditions and priorities at a particular DOE site.  Other sites may determine a different weighting system.  Sites could choose to develop scenarios or drills in which to conduct in-field observations, or simply observe workers in their normal working 
environments.

 2.    Discussion Questions:  
 
RW I personnel enter radiological buffer areas and radiation areas, but 
do not engage in activities requiring protective clothing.  The following 
questions could be part of the discussion: 
 
a. How many millirem of whole body dose do you normally receive 
on your job in a year? 
b. What is your annual whole body  dose limit; administrative dose 
guideline; when was the last time it was reported? 
c. What types of radiation hazard exist at your facility? d. What types of radiation (i.e., alpha, beta, etc) are you exposed to 
in the course of your work?  How do you protect yourself from these hazards?

handling dosimeters? 
j. What radiological training are you required to take?  How does 
your training relate to your job? 
 
 3.    Written Exam:  
 
RW I training has recommended objectives for the core course plus any site specific objectives added for the site.  The following 
approaches to retesting are being successfully applied throughout the 
DOE complex: 
 
a. Conducting written retests twice each year on a sample of the 
trainees taught during the previous 6 months. 
b. Retesting a sample of trainees 4 to 6 months following their 
training. 
c. Retesting all objectives for a sample of trainees. d. Retesting only those objectives that were found to be difficult for 
trainees to learn, remember, or apply in the previous 6 months. 
 
Whichever pattern a site selects, the results should provide the data 
needed to meet the determined purposes of the evaluations.

 E. RCT Training   
 
1. In-Field Observation:  
 
RCT training consists of several phases.  In Phase I, core lessons teach academic theory.  Different sites have organized and emphasized the information in different ways to fit the needs and practices at the sites.  In Phase II, practical skills are taught based on a site specific job assessment. 
 
One difficulty in performing on-the-job observations is correlating the schedule of the observer with the schedule of the trainee.  One approach to resolving this problem is to associate specific skills or tasks learned in the training with work evolutions that normally occur at 
the site. 
 
Table 5 lists the tasks that will commonly appear in Phase II training in the left-hand column.  The top row lists work evolutions where these tasks might be observed.  A matrix could be prepared by marking an 
"X" in a box to show that a particular task can be observed in a 
particular evolution.  The matrix could then be used to correlate with the procedures governing that evolution or task.  An alternative is to prepare a checklist to use during the observation.  Table 6 shows a sample of such a checklist.

COMMENTS   (List by reference number) 
  
 
  2. Discussion Questions:  
 
RCTs support radiological work and engage in all activities in radiological 
areas.  The following questions could be part of the discussion: 
 
a. How many millirems of dose do you normally receive on your job in a 
year? 
b. What is your annual whole body dose limit?  Administrative dose 
guideline; when was the last time it was reported? 
c. What types of radiological hazards exist at your facility? d. What types of radiation (i.e., alpha, beta, etc) are you exposed to in the 
course of your work?  How do you protect yourself from these hazards? 
e. How do you practice ALARA in your work? 
f. What is the sound of continuous air monitor alarms for your workplace? 
g. How are employees at your work area warned of radiological hazards? h. What are the biological symptoms you might display with increasing 
exposures to radiation? 
i. What obligations do you have to maintain exposure to radiation ALARA? j. What is dosimetry?  What precautions should be taken when handling 
dosimeters? 
k. What practices do you take to assure you do not spread contamination 
while donning or doffing PCs? 
l. What radiological training are you required to take?  How does your 
training relate to your job? 
 
3. Written Exam:  
 
Each site should determine critical objectives to be retested for each lesson or class. Consideration should be given to the likelihood of a trainee having the opportunity to apply the skills from the training in an actual work 
environment.  If the trainee is in training for an extended period of time, 2 to 
4 months may pass without having had the opportunity to use the skills in actual work.

General Employee Radiological Training (GERT) is provided to all site employees who receive occupational exposure during access to controlled areas at a DOE site or 
facility or who are permitted unescorted 
access to controlled areas.  These individuals may routinely enter the controlled area and encounter radiological barriers, postings, radiation producing 
devices or radioactive materials.  Employee 
responsibilities for observing and obeying radiological postings and procedures are emphasized throughout this training. 
 
Additional training beyond GERT is required for 
the employees who are identified as  
radiological workers.  Every employee, both  radiological worker and non-radiological worker, must play an active part in maintaining  exposures to radiation and radioactive  materials within DOE limits and As Low As Is  Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).       
 
        
   
 
    
OPTIONAL:  
Discuss and/or display various signs 
that the worker may be familiar with 
(e.g., road signs, restroom signs, no 
smoking signs, etc.) and site specific signs they may encounter on the job.  Discuss: 
 
Relate the responsibilities 
associated with road signs to responsibilities with radiological postings.  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

 3GERT qualified individuals should be able to  
 place the risks associated with working at a  nuclear facility in perspective with other 
risks that we take in our everyday life.

1. Terminal Goal 2. Enabling Objectives  
II. LESSON 
 
A. Non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation 
(EO1)  
 
Radiation is energy emitted through space and matter.  This energy release 
is in the form of rays or particles and is 
emitted from unstable atoms or various radiation-producing devices, such as televisions and X-ray machines. 
 
1. Atoms 
 
The elements that make up all matter are composed of atoms.  Atoms have three basic particles; protons, neutrons and electrons. 
 
a. Stable atoms  
 
Most atoms are stable and do not emit excess energy. 
 
 b. Unstable atoms 
 
Unstable atoms emit excess energy.  This energy is called radiation. 
 
    
List examples of other activities that have risks (e.g., smoking, driving a 
car, eating fatty foods, etc.)  The 
risks from these activities will be discussed later.  
 
 
     
 
EO1 - IDENTIFY basic radiological fundamentals and radiation protection concepts.

2. Ionizing radiation 
 
Ionizing radiation has enough 
energy to remove electrons from electrically neutral atoms. 
 
• There are four basic types of 
ionizing radiation; alpha 
particles, beta particles, neutrons and gamma rays.  
 
3. Non-ionizing radiation 
 
Non-ionizing radiation does not have 
enough energy to remove an electron from an atom.  • Types of non-ionizing radiation 
include:  Microwaves, radio 
waves, visible light, heat, and infrared radiation. 
 
Non-ionizing radiation is not 
addressed further in this training. 
 
4. Radioactive Contamination 
 
Contamination is uncontained radioactive material in an unwanted 
location. 
 
5. Comparison of radiation and 
radioactive contamination 
 
Exposure to radiation does NOT
 
result in contamination of the worker.  Only in the case of an individual coming in contact with radioactive contamination would there be a potential for the individual’s skin or 
clothing to become contaminated. 
    
  
 
Note:  X-rays are identical to gamma rays except for their place of origin.  X-rays originate from a shell electron and gamma rays originate from the 
nucleus of an atom. 
     
 
Insert facility-specific information if hazardous non-ionizing radiation sources are present.  
 
 OPTIONAL: Draw/show example of electromagnetic spectrum.  Explain that these are all radiation, but have 
different energy levels.  (Relate this 
concept by comparing microwaves/radio waves/visible light). 
 
   
Use example(s), such as a camp fire 
or powdered donuts, to depict the 
concept of radiation vs. contamination.  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

B. Sources of Radiation (EO1)  
   People have always been exposed to 
radiation.  Radiation, simply defined, is energy emitted through space and matter.  We are exposed to radiation from naturally-occurring sources in our 
environment, man-made sources, and 
even from materials inside our bodies. 
 
• The average annual radiation dose 
to a member of the general population is about 360  
millirem/year.  This amount is a 
combination of both natural background and man-made sources of radiation. 
 
1. Natural background sources of 
radiation 
 
Natural background radiation is by far the largest contributor (about 300 
millirem/year) to radiation doses.  
The main sources of natural background radiation are listed below: 
 
a. Cosmic radiation - radiation from 
the sun and outer space, varies 
with altitude, (e.g., Denver would be higher than Miami).  
 
b. Radon - (the principal source of 
background radiation exposure.) 
A gas from naturally-occurring uranium in the soil. 
 c. Terrestrial radiation from 
naturally- occurring radioactive 
material found in the earth's 
crust , such as uranium found in 
rocks and soil.  
  
EO1 - IDENTIFY basic radiological fundamentals and radiation 
protection concepts.  
    
 
  Explain that just as the inch is a basic unit to measure distance, the rem is the basic unit of measure 
used to equate the amount of 
potential biological damage done to our bodies by radiation. (1 rem = 1000 millirem)  
 
  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 
General Employee Radiological Training                              Instructor’s Guide  
 
 6d. Materials present in our bodies .  
These come from naturally-occurring radioactive material 
present in our food, such as 
Potassium-40. 
 
2. Man-made sources of radiation 
 
Man-made sources of radiation, 
where the radiation is either produced or enhanced by human activities, contribute to the remainder of the annual average radiation dose (approximately 60 millirem).  Man-
made sources include the following: 
 
a. Medical uses such as X rays 
and nuclear medicine  tests or treatments 
 
b. Tobacco products 
 
c. Building materials 
   
 
3. Comparison of annual radiation 
doses from selected sources 
 
Examples of the annual radiation dose (mrem) from selected sources 
of radiation exposure are as follows: 
 
• Cigarette smoking 1300  
   (1 pack a day) 1300     
• Radon 200 
 
• Medical exposures 54  
   (average) 54  
• Terrestrial radiation  
      (rocks and soil)  28  
 
• Cosmic radiation       (sun and space)   28   
  
 
    
 
     
 
    
 
    
 
 
   
Note that these are average figures 
and can vary significantly depending on the individual’s location and specific attributes associated with 
the exposure. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

C. Risks in Perspective  (EO2)  
 
Radiation comes from background and man-made sources. We receive approximately 360 millirem/year.  This is separate from, and in 
addition to, occupational exposure 
received on the job.  The potential risks from occupational exposure can be compared to other risks we accept everyday. 
 
1. Occupational  dose 
 
The risks associated with occupational  doses are very small and considered acceptable when 
compared to that of other 
occupational health risks (i.e., being a coal miner or construction worker).  a. Radiation dose limit (EO3) 
 
The DOE whole body radiation dose limit for general employees is 5000 millirem/year.  
 
  
 
  
           
EO2 - IDENTIFY the relative risks of 
exposure to radiation and 
radioactive materials, including 
prenatal radiation exposure.    
 
    
OPTIONAL: 
Include the most recent average annual radiation dose for non-radiological workers and radiological workers at the site.  
 
   EO3 - IDENTIFY engineered and 
administrative controls, limits, 
policies, procedures, alarms, and other measures implemented at the facility to control doses.

 8b. Administrative Control Levels 
  Sites typically have 
administrative control levels 
below the DOE limit.  (Insert facility-specific limits).  Individuals who complete only this GERT training are not 
expected to receive more than 
100 millirem/yr occupational dose.   
 c. Average annual radiation dose 
for various occupations 
 
DOE radiological workers who received measurable radiological doses had an average dose of 61millirem in 
2005.  This amount is compared 
to other occupations. 
 
Occupation (millirem/year)
 
• Airline flight crew member 
 400-600 
• Nuclear power plant worker  300 • Medical personnel  70 
 
2. Potential health effects from 
exposure to radiation.  (EO2) 
 
Biological effects from exposure to radiation may
 occur in the exposed 
individual or in the future children of 
the exposed individual.

exposure to radiation and 
radioactive materials, including 
prenatal radiation exposure.  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 
General Employee Radiological Training                              Instructor’s Guide  
 
 9a.  Exposed individual 
 There is scientific evidence for 
health effects (primarily cancer) 
from radiation doses well above the annual limit for occupational exposure (greater than 10,000 millirem) received under a short 
duration.  The risks associated with 
occupational doses are very small and considered acceptable when compared to other occupational and non-occupational risks. 
 
 For very large doses received over 
a short period of time (referred to as an acute exposure), prompt effects (i.e., effects that appear shortly after the exposure) may result.  These 
doses are received typically under 
accident conditions such as the firefighters responding to the Chernobyl accident.  These effects may include reddening of the skin, 
vomiting, hair loss, or even death.  
  For small doses received over a 
long period of time (referred to as a chronic exposure), delayed effects (i.e., effects that appear long after 
the exposure) may result.  These 
effects include an increased risk of cancer.  Although there is no scientific evidence for health effects (such as cancer) from radiation 
doses well below the annual limit for 
occupational exposure, we assume that any exposure, no matter how low, has an associated risk of health effects (such as cancer).      
 
 
    
    
 
    
 
     
Refer to Table 1 in the Student 
Guide on biological effects of acute doses.   
 
    
 
   OPTIONAL: The current rate of cancer deaths in the US from all 
causes is ~20%.  Many things can 
cause cancer, including high exposures to radiation.  A 25,000 millirem dose would result in an increased risk of cancer from 20% 
(background rate) to 21%.DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

 10 b. Future children of the exposed  
  individual  
 
 Heritable effects (i.e., genetic 
changes to the parents sperm and/or eggs that results in an observed effect in their offspring) from ionizing radiation have been 
found in plants and animals, but 
have not been observed in human populations.  The risk of heritable effects from ionizing radiation is considered to be very small when compared to other naturally-
occurring heritable effects and 
difficult to detect over the natural background rate of birth defects. 
 
3. Prenatal  effects (EO2) 
 
 A developing embryo/fetus is 
especially sensitive to ionizing radiation because of its rapidly dividing cells .  Radiation is one of 
many agents that may cause harm 
to the embryo/fetus (i.e., chemicals, heat, etc.).  Significant radiation doses (>10,000 millirem) to the embryo/fetus may increase the chances that the child will develop 
conditions such as a small head 
size, lower birth weight, and/or slower mental growth. 
 
  a. Possible effects 
 
 Radiation dose to the 
embryo/fetus may increase the chances that the child will develop conditions such as slower growth or mental 
development or childhood 
cancer.  These effects can also be caused by many other hazards in our environment.  
 
 
 
    
 
    
 
 
    
 
EO2 - IDENTIFY the relative risks of exposure to radiation and radioactive materials, including prenatal radiation exposure. 
 
     
 
    
Optional: The natural rate of birth 
defects in the US is ~ 11%.  A 25,000 millirem dose to the fetus/embryo may increase the chance of a birth defect from 11% to 11.1%. 
 
DISCUSS declared pregnant worker.

 11 
b.    DOE Limits (EO2) 
    The risk of these effects 
occurring is minimized by 
having special protective measures for the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant woman.  This is a worker who voluntarily 
notifies her employer, in writing, 
that she is pregnant and wishes to invoke the limit for the embryo/fetus of 500 millirem for the period from conception to birth. 
 
It is the recommendation of 
DOE’s Radiological Control Standard that the employer provide the option for a 
reassignment of work tasks to a 
declared pregnant worker, without loss of pay or promotional opportunity, such that further occupational 
radiation exposure is unlikely. 
 
4. Comparison of risks of occupational 
radiation doses with other health risks (EO2) 
 
The risk of working with or around 
sources of ionizing radiation can be compared to the risks we accept as part of everyday life. 
 
  These data address the expected 
effect on the average life span of a large population of individuals subjected to the risk factor/behavior in question. 
 
 
 EO2 - IDENTIFY the relative risks of 
exposure to radiation and radioactive materials, including 
prenatal radiation exposure. 
    
Note: Explain that there are ongoing 
scientific discussions concerning the validity of extrapolating high dose data to these very low numbers.  The real risk may actually be significantly lower.

(accident) 
• Flying 2500 miles in a jet 
(accident) 
• Canoeing for 6 minutes 
       •    Receiving 2.5 mrem of 
radiation (cancer)  
 
5.   Benefit versus risk (EO2) 
  In summary, the estimated risk 
associated with occupational radiation dose, when compared to other occupational and non-
occupational risks , is considered to 
be within the normal range of risk tolerance by national and international scientific groups who have studied these issues.  Clearly 
though, the acceptance of risk is a 
personal matter that each individual must make for themselves and is best made with accurate information. 
  
D. Radiological Controls (EO3) 
 
 Radiological controls are established to 
protect individuals from unplanned or uncontrolled exposure to radiation and from ingestion, inhalation, or absorption of radioactive material. These controls 
include, but are not limited to, a unique 
system of identifying radioactive materials using certain colors and/or symbols and radiological postings, implementation of controls to maintain 
radiation exposures As Low As 
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), and training of workers on radiation safety and emergency response.

 152. Postings (EO3) 
  Postings are used to alert personnel 
of a potential or known radiological 
condition and to aid them in controlling exposures and preventing the spread of contamination.   
 
a. Controlled Area 
  Controlled areas are areas 
established around radiological areas to manage personnel access to the radiological areas and to 
provide warning of the existence of 
radiological hazards in the area. 
  This training will permit you  
unescorted entry into the controlled 
area. 
 b. Radioactive Material Area   This is an area within a controlled 
area where radioactive material in 
excess of specified quantities is located. 
  This training alone typically will not 
permit you unescorted access to 
these areas. 
 c.  Radiological Areas   There are radiological areas 
established within the controlled 
area.

 16“Radiation Area, High Radiation 
Area, and Very High Radiation Area,” identify areas where the 
hazard is exposure to ionizing 
radiation and the different areas designate increasing levels of hazard (increasing levels of dose rates). 
 
“Contamination Area” and “High Contamination Area” identify areas where the hazard is from accessible loose radioactive contamination.  Protective clothing is used to prevent 
contamination of personnel. 
 
“Airborne Radioactivity Area” indicates the potential for radioactive contamination in the air.  Protective 
clothing and respiratory protection 
may be used to protect personnel from getting contamination on their skin or inhaling the contamination.” 
 
This training typically will NOT
 
permit you to enter these areas.  Personnel trained at the GERT level are typically not permitted to enter these areas unless escorted and/or trained. 
 
d. Radiological Buffer Area 
 
  A radiological buffer area may be  
established within the controlled area to provide a secondary 
boundary for minimizing exposures 
to radiation or contamination. 
   This training typically does NOT 
qualify you to enter the radiological buffer area unless you are 
continuously escorted.  (Insert 
facility-specific requirements.)

 17E.   ALARA Program (EO4) 
 
1.  ALARA Concept  
The DOE and this Site are firmly committed to having a Radiological Control Program of the highest quality.  Therefore, maintaining 
occupational dose from radiation 
and radioactive materials As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) is an integral part of all site activities.  The purpose of the ALARA program is to control radiation doses in 
consideration of the overall benefit of 
the activity causing the dose.  There are a few basic practices used to maintain exposure to radiation 
ALARA. 
 
a. Time-Reduce the amount of time 
spent near a source of radiation. 
 
b. Distance-Stay as far away from the 
source as possible. 
 c. Shielding-Shielding is placed 
between workers and the source.  
d.   Source elimination or reduction: 
Eliminate the source, if possible (e.g., flushing the pipeline) or substitute with non-radioactive substance.
  
 
e. Radioactive contamination is 
controlled using engineered ventilation, containments, decontamination, and lastly, personnel protective equipment to 
minimize the potential for inhalation, 
ingestion, or absorption of radioactive material. 
  
  
 
  EO4 - IDENTIFY individual rights and responsibilities as related to 
implementation of the radiation 
protection program (including the ALARA Program.)    
 
OPTIONAL: Discuss the radiological control philosophy that there be no personnel dose without 
commensurate benefit. 
    
 
 OPTIONAL: Discuss some facility-specific examples of each of these exposure control techniques.

 18F.     Emergency Procedures  (EO5)  
 
 In the unlikely event that a 
radiological incident occurs, it is 
important for each employee to know the emergency procedures. 
 
1. Abnormal Conditions  
 
  If you discover radioactive material 
that is not where it belongs, (e.g., discarded in a clean trash receptacle, outside of radiological areas, or loose outside or in a 
building corridor), you should take 
the following actions: 
 
a. Do not touch or handle the 
material.  
 b. Warn other personnel not to 
approach the area. 
 c. Guard the area, moving a safe distance, (see following ALARA Section) and have someone 
immediately notify Radiological 
Control personnel.  d. Await Radiological Control personnel.  
These actions are taken to minimize 
exposure to radiation and potential contamination of yourself and others.

 19G.     Employee Responsibilities (EO4)  
 
All employees have an impact on 
maintaining exposures to radiation 
and radioactive material ALARA.  Work planning is a key component of the ALARA program to ensure each of the controls listed below is 
applied as appropriate to the work 
being performed.  Some of the employee responsibilities are listed.  
1. Obey all signs/postings. 
 
2. Comply with all radiological and 
safety rules.  
 
3. Do not enter any radiological area 
unless escorted.  If visiting a 
radiological area with an escort: 
 
  a. obey the instructions of your escort.  
 
b. obtain and properly wear 
dosimeters as instructed by procedure, Radiological Control personnel, or your escort.  c. utilize ALARA techniques to 
control your exposure. 
 
4. Be alert for and report unusual 
radiological situations. 
 
Unusual situations may include 
finding radioactive material outside a designated area or finding a compromised radiological barrier.   
 
    
EO4 - IDENTIFY individual rights and responsibilities as related to 
implementation of the radiation 
protection program (including the ALARA Program).  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 
General Employee Radiological Training                              Instructor’s Guide  
 
 205. Know where and/or how to contact 
Radiological Control personnel in your work area. 
 
6. Comply with emergency procedures 
for your work area. 
 
7. Keep exposures to radiation and 
radioactive materials ALARA and 
know the Administrative Control Levels and Dose Limits. 
 8. Know your cumulative and annual 
dose. 
 
H.     Monitoring (Dosimetry)  
 
Since radiation cannot
 be detected 
with the human senses, special 
detection devices must be used.  
Workers should become familiar with the equipment and devices used to measure and detect radiation and radioactive material, as applicable to 
their job functions.  Monitoring is 
only required if you are likely to receive a dose in excess of 100 millirem in a year.  Therefore, it is possible based on your job function and location that you will not be 
provided a dosimeter. 
 (Insert facility-specific information) 
 
Some workers are monitored for 
intakes of radioactive material (e.g., 
inhaling or ingesting radioactive material).  This is typically done by either using an apparatus (e.g., whole body counter) to detect the material in the body or by analyzing 
a sample the individual provides 
(e.g., urinalysis).    
  
 
    
 
     
 
  
Discuss/show dosimeters used at facility.  Discuss any facility specific 
monitoring used for GERT trained 
employees.

 21I.       Exposure Reports (EO6)  
 
Although DOE and DOE contractor 
employees who are only trained at 
the GERT level are not expected to receive occupational dose above the monitoring threshold, they may be monitored for exposure in any case.  
This could occur during escorted 
entries into radiologically controlled areas or in other circumstances.  Individuals who are monitored for exposure at DOE facilities have the right to request reports of that 
exposure as follows: 
 •     Upon the request from an 
individual terminating employment, records of radiation 
exposure dose shall be provided 
by the DOE facility within 90 days.  If requested, a written estimate of radiation exposure received by the terminating 
employee shall be provided at 
the time of termination. 
 • Each individual who is required 
to be monitored for radiation exposure at a DOE facility shall 
receive a report of that exposure 
on an annual basis. 
 Note: As previously discussed, individuals may be monitored with a 
dosimeter even though they are not 
required to be monitored.  In this case an annual report is not required to be sent.   
 
    
 
 
EO6 - IDENTIFY exposure reports 
or other exposure data that may be 
provided and how to request these reports.  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007 
 
General Employee Radiological Training                              Instructor’s Guide  
 
 22• Detailed information concerning 
any individual’s exposure shall be made available to the individual upon request of that individual. 
 • When a DOE contractor is 
required to report to the Department, pursuant to Departmental requirements for occurrence reporting and processing, any exposure of an individual to radiation and/or radioactive material, or planned special exposure, the contractor shall also provide that individual with a report on his/her exposure data included therein.  Such a report shall be transmitted at a time not later than the transmittal to the Department. 
 
III. SUMMARY  
 
It is important to understand what radiation and radioactive materials are and to recognize the postings associated with radiological work.  All employees are responsible to comply with the safety rules and to access only areas they are authorized to enter.  Through an enhanced awareness of this topic, each employee may contribute to safe practices in the workplace.

 3I.LESSON INTRODUCTION  
 A. Self Introduction  
   1. Name 
   2. Phone Number    3. Background  
B. Course Overview  
 
General Employee Radiological Training  (GERT) is provided to all site 
employees who receive occupational exposure during access to controlled 
areas at a DOE site or facility or  who are permitted unescorted access to 
controlled areas.  These individuals ma y routinely enter the controlled area 
and encounter radiological barriers, pos tings, radiation producing devices or 
radioactive materials.  Employee re sponsibilities for observing and obeying 
radiological postings and procedures ar e emphasized throughout this training. 
 
• Additional training beyond GERT is required for the employees who are 
identified as radiological  workers.  Every empl oyee, both radiological 
worker and non-radiological worker, must play an active part in maintaining exposures to radiation and radioactive materials within DOE 
limits and As Low As Reason ably Achievable (ALARA). 
   • GERT qualified individuals should  be able to place the risks associated 
with working at a nuclear facility in perspective with other risks that we 
take in our everyday life.

 4C. Introduce Objectives  
   1. Terminal Goal 
   2. Enabling Objectives  
II. LESSON  
 
A. Non-ionizing and Ioni zing Radiation  (EO1)  
 
Radiation is energy emitted through space and matter.  This energy release is 
in the form of rays or particles and is  emitted from unstable atoms or various 
radiation-producing devices, such as televisions and X-ray machines. 
 
1. Atoms 
 
The elements that make up all matte r are composed of atoms.  Atoms 
have three basic particles: protons, neutrons and electrons. 
 
a. Stable atoms  
     Most atoms are stable and do not emit excess energy   
b. Unstable atoms 
 
Unstable atoms emit excess energy.  Th is energy is called radiation.  
 
2. Ionizing radiation 
 
Ionizing radiation has enough energy to re move electrons from electrically 
neutral atoms. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
General Employee Radiological Training                                 Student’s Guide  
 
 5 
• There are four basic types of ioni zing radiation; al pha particles, beta 
particles, neutrons and gamma rays.  
 
3. Non-ionizing radiation 
 
Non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to remove an 
electron from an atom.   • Types of non-ionizing radiation in clude:  Microwaves, radio waves, 
visible light, heat, and infrared radiation. 
 
Non-ionizing radiation is not addr essed further in this training. 
 
4. Radioactive Contamination 
 
Contamination is uncontained radi oactive material in an unwanted 
location. 
 
5. Comparison of radiation and radioactive contamination 
 
Exposure to radiation does NOT
 result in contaminat ion of the worker.  
Only in the case of an individual coming in contact with radioactive contamination would ther e be a potential for the individual’s skin or 
clothing to become contaminated.

 6B. Sources of Radiation (EO1)  
 
  People have always been exposed to radiat ion.  Radiation, simply defined, is 
energy emitted through space and matter.  We are exposed to radiation from 
naturally-occurring sources in our env ironment, man-made sources, and even 
from materials inside our bodies. 
 
• The average annual radiation dose to a member of the general population 
is about 360 millirem/year.  This amount is a combination of both natural 
background and man-made s ources of radiation. 
 
1. Natural background sources of radiation 
 
Natural background radiation is by fa r the largest contributor (about 300 
millirem/year) to radiation doses.  The main sources of natural background radiation are listed below: 
 
a. Cosmic radiation
 - radiation from the sun and  outer space, varies with 
altitude, (e.g., Denver w ould be higher than Miami).  
 
b. Radon - (the principal source of  background radiation exposure.) A 
gas from naturally-occurring uranium in the soil. 
 
c. Terrestrial radiation from naturally -occurring radioactive material found 
in the earth's crust , such as uranium found in rocks and soil.  
 
d. Materials present in our bodies .  These come from naturally-occurring  
radioactive material present in our food, such as Potassium-40. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
General Employee Radiological Training                                 Student’s Guide  
 
 72. Man-made source s of radiation 
 
Man-made sources of radiat ion, where the radiati on is either produced or 
enhanced by human activities, contribut e to the remainder of the annual 
average radiation dose (approximately 60 millirem).  Man-made sources 
include the following: 
 
a. Medical uses such as X-rays and nuc lear medicine tests or treatments 
 
b. Tobacco products 
 
c. Building materials 
      DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
General Employee Radiological Training                                 Student’s Guide  
 
 83. Comparison of annual radiati on doses from selected sources 
 
Examples of the annual radiation dose from selected sour ces of radiation 
exposure are as follows: 
 
• Cigarette smoking 1300  
    (1 pack a day) 
 •     Radon  200 
 
• Medical exposures 54  
    (average)  
• Terrestrial radiation (rocks and soil) 28  
 
• Cosmic radiation (sun and space) 28  
 
• Round trip US by air 5  
 
• Building materials 7  
 
• World wide fallout <1 
 
 •    Domestic water supply 5 
 
• Natural gas range 0.2  
 
• Smoke detectors 0.001

General Employee Radiological Training                                 Student’s Guide  
 
 9C. Risks in Perspective  (EO2)  
 
Radiation comes from background and man-made sources. We receive 
approximately 360 millirem/year .  This is separate fr om, and in addition to, 
occupational exposure received on t he job.  The potential risks from 
occupational exposure can be compared to other risks we accept everyday. 
 
1. Occupational  dose 
 
The risks associated with occupational  doses are very small and 
considered acceptable when compared to that of other occupational 
health risks (i.e., being a coal mi ner or construction worker). 
 
a. Radiation dose limit (EO3) 
 
The DOE whole body radiation dose  limit for general employees is 
5000 millirem/year.  
 
b. Administrative Control Levels 
 
Sites typically have administrative c ontrol levels below the DOE limit.  
(Insert facility-specific  limits).  Individuals who complete only this 
GERT training are not expected to receive more than 100 millirem/yr 
occupational dose.   
 
 c. Average annual radiation dose for various occupations 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 10DOE radiological workers who received measurable radiological  
doses had an average  dose of 63 millirem in 2006.  This amount is compared to other occupations. 
 
Occupation
 millirem/year  
• Airline flight crew member 400-600 • Nuclear power plant worker  300 • Medical personnel 70 
 
2. Potential  health effects from  exposure to radiation.  (EO2) 
 
Biological effects from ex posure to radiation may
 occur in the exposed 
individual or in the future child ren of the exposed individual. 
 
a. Exposed individual 
 
There is scientific evidence for health  effects (primarily cancer) from 
radiation doses well above the annual  limit for occupational exposure 
(greater than 10,000 millir em) received under a short duration.  The 
risks associated with occupationa l doses are very small and 
considered acceptable when com pared to other occupational and non-
occupational risks. 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 11For very large doses received over a short period of time (referred to 
as an acute exposure), prompt effect s (i.e., effects that appear shortly 
after the exposure) may result.  These doses are received typically 
under accident conditions such as the firefighters responding to the 
Chernobyl accident.  These effects may include reddening of the skin, vomiting, hair loss, or even death. 
  
Table 1 
Prompt Biological Effects 
  
Dose (rad)  
Effect 
 
0-25  
None detectable through 
symptoms or routine blood 
tests.  
25-100  
Changes in blood.  
100-300  
Nausea, anorexia.  
300-600  
Diarrhea, hemorrhage, and 
possible death 
 
 For small doses received over a long period of time (referred to as a 
chronic exposure), delayed effects (i .e., effects that appear long after 
the exposure) may result.  These effects include an increased risk of 
cancer.  Although there is no scientific evidence for health effects (such as cancer) from radiation do ses well below the annual limit for 
occupational exposure, we assume that any exposure, no matter how 
low, has an associated risk of health effects (such as cancer).

General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 12b. Future children of the exposed individual 
 
  Heritable effects (i.e., genetic changes to the parents sperm and/or 
eggs that results in an observed effect  in their offspring) from ionizing 
radiation have been found in plants and animals, but have not been observed in human populations.  The risk of heritable effects from 
ionizing radiation is considered to  be very small when compared to 
other naturally-occurring heritable effe cts and difficult to detect over 
the natural background rate of birth defects. 
 
3. Prenatal  effects (EO2) 
 
A developing embryo/fetus is especiall y sensitive to ionizing radiation 
because of its rapidly dividing cells .  Radiation is one of many agents that 
may cause harm to the embryo/fetus (i.e., chemicals, heat, etc.).  
Significant radiation doses (>10,000 millirem) to the embryo/fetus may 
increase the chances that the child wil l develop conditions such as a small 
head size, lower birth weight, and/ or slower mental growth. 
 a. Possible effects 
 
Radiation dose to the embryo/fetus may increase the chances that the 
child will develop conditions such  as slower growth or mental 
development or childhood cancer.  These effects can also be caused by many other hazards in our environment. 
 
b. DOE Limits  (EO2) 
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 13 The risk of these effects occurring  is minimized by having special 
protective measures for the em bryo/fetus of a declared pregnant 
woman.  This is a worker who vo luntarily notifies her employer, in 
writing, that she is pregnant and wis hes to invoke the limit for the 
embryo/fetus of 500 millirem for the period from conception to birth. 
  It is the recommendation of DOE’s Radiological Control Standard that 
the employer provide the option for a reassignment of work tasks to a 
declared pregnant worker, without loss of pay or promotional 
opportunity, such that further oc cupational radiat ion exposure is 
unlikely. 
 
4. Comparison of risks of occupationa l radiation doses with other health risks 
(EO2) 
 
The risk of working with or around s ources of ionizing radiation can be 
compared to the risks we accept  as part of everyday life. 
 
  These data address the expected effect  on the average life span of a large 
population of individuals subjected to the risk factor/behavior in question.

 14a. Loss of life expectancy due to various causes (Expressed in days) 
 
    Estimated Days of Life 
Health Risk Expectancy Lost, Average  
• Being unmarried male 3500  • Smoking (1 pack/day)  2250  • Being unmarried female 1600  • Being a coal miner 1100  • 15% overweight  777  • Alcohol (US average) 365  • Being a construction worker 227  • Driving a motor vehicle  205  • All industry 60  • Radiation 100 mrem/yr (70 yr) 10  • Coffee (US Average) 6  
 
b.  The following activities create a ri sk of 1 in a million chances of dying 
• Smoking 1.4 cigarettes (lung cancer) • Eating 40 tablespoons of peanut butter • Eating 100 charcoal broiled steaks • Spending 2 days in New York City (air pollution) • Driving 40 miles in a car (accident) • Flying 2500 miles in a jet (accident) • Canoeing for 6 minutes • Receiving 2.5 mrem of radiation (cancer)  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 155. Benefit versus risk (EO2) 
 
In summary, the estimated risk asso ciated with occupational radiation 
dose, when compared to other oc cupational and non-occupational risks , 
is considered to be within the normal range of risk tolerance by national and international scientific groups who have studied these issues.  Clearly though, the acceptance of risk is a per sonal matter that each individual 
must make for themselves and is best made with accurate information. 
 
D. Radiological Controls  (EO3)  
 
Radiological controls are established to  protect individuals from unplanned or 
uncontrolled exposure to radiation and from ingestion, inhalation, or 
absorption of radioactive material. These controls include, but are not limited 
to, a unique system of identifying radioacti ve materials using certain colors 
and/or symbols and radiological postings , implementation of controls to 
maintain radiation exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), 
and training of workers on radiati on safety and emergency response. 
 
1. Radiological identification system(s) 
 
Only specially trained/qualified work ers are permitted to enter areas 
controlled for radiological purposes or  handle radioactive material.  All 
areas or material controlled for radiol ogical purposes are identified by one 
or more of the following. 
 
 a. Signs that have the standard r adiation symbol colored magenta or 
black on a yellow background are used. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 16 
 b. Yellow and magenta r ope, tape, chains or ot her barriers are used to 
designate the boundaries of posted areas.  
 
 c. Tags and labels with a yellow background and eit her a magenta or 
black standard radiation symbol ar e used to identify radioactive 
material. 
 
"CAUTION-RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL" 
 
 d. Yellow plastic wrapping, yellow plastic bags and labeled containers 
are used to package radioactive material. 
 
 e. Designated areas  are used to store radioactive material. 
 
f. Protective clothing used to prevent  personnel contamination is yellow 
and/or distinctively marked. 
 
g. Potentially contaminated tool s, and portable equipment used for 
radiological work are marked. 
 
2. Postings (EO3) 
 
Postings are used to alert personnel of  a potential or known radiological 
condition and to aid them in cont rolling exposures and preventing the 
spread of contamination.   
 
a. Controlled Area DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 17 
1)       Controlled areas are ar eas established around radiological areas 
to manage personnel access to the radiological areas and to provide warning of the existence of radiological hazards in the 
area. 
 
2)       This training will permit you unescorted entry into the controlled 
area. 
 
b. Radioactive Material Area 
 
1)       This is an area within a c ontrolled area where radioactive material 
in excess of specified quantities is located. 
 
2)       This training alone typi cally will not permit you unescorted access 
to these areas. 
 
c.  Radiological Areas 
 
1)       There are radi ological areas established wit hin the controlled area.   
 
“Radiation Area, High Radiation Area, and Very High Radiation 
Area,” identify areas where the haza rd is exposure to ionizing 
radiation and the different areas designate increasing levels of 
hazard (increasing levels of dose rates). 
 
“Contamination Area” and “High Contamination Area” identify 
areas where the hazard is from  accessible loose radioactive DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 18contamination.  Protective clothing is used to prevent 
contamination of personnel. 
 
“Airborne Radioactivity Area” indica tes the potential for radioactive 
contamination in the air.  Protective cl othing and respiratory 
protection may be used to protect personnel from getting contamination on their skin or inhaling the contamination.” 
 
2)       This training typically will NOT
 permit you to enter these areas.  
Personnel trained at the GERT leve l are typically not permitted to 
enter these areas unless escorted and/or trained. 
 
d. Radiological Buffer Area 
 
  1) A radiological buffer area may be established within the 
controlled area to provide a se condary boundary for minimizing 
exposures to radiation or contamination. 
 
  2) This training typically does NOT qualify you to enter the 
radiological buffer area unless you are continuously escorted.  (Insert facility-specific requirements.) 
 
 E. ALARA Program  (EO4)  
 
  1. ALARA Concept 
 
The DOE and this Site are firmly committed to having a Radiological 
Control Program of the highest qua lity.  Therefore, maintaining DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 19occupational dose from radiation and radioactive materials As Low As 
Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) is an int egral part of all site activities.  
The purpose of the ALARA program is  to control radiation doses in 
consideration of the over all benefit of the activity causing the  dose. 
 
There are a few basic practices used to maintain exposure to radiation ALARA. 
 
 a. Time-Reduce the amount of time  spent near a source of radiation. 
 
 b. Distance-Stay as far away from the source as possible. 
 
 c. Shielding-Shielding is pl aced between workers and the source. 
 
 d. Source elimination or reduction: Eliminate the source, if possible (e.g., 
flushing the pipeline) or substitu te with non-radioactive substance.
  
  e. Radioactive contamination is controlled using engi neered ventilation, 
containments, decontamination, and lastly, personnel protective 
equipment to minimize the potentia l for inhalation, ingestion, or 
absorption of radioactive material. 
 
F. Emergency Procedures  (EO5)   
 
In the unlikely event that a radiological  incident occurs, it is important for 
each employee to know the emergency procedures. 
 
  1. Abnormal Conditions DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 20 
  If you discover radioactive material that is not where it belongs, (e.g., 
discarded in a clean trash receptacle, outside of radiological areas, or loose outside or in a building corrido r), you should take the following 
actions:  
 
1) Do not touch or handle the material.  
 
2) Warn other personnel not to approach the area. 
 
3) Guard the area, moving a safe  distance, (see following ALARA 
Section) and have someone immediat ely notify Radiological Control 
personnel. 
 
4) Await Radiological Control personnel. 
 
These actions are taken to minimize  exposure to radiation and potential 
contamination of y ourself and others.

All employees have an impact on maintaining exposures to radiation and radioactive material ALARA.  Work  planning is a key component of the 
ALARA program to ensure each of the controls listed below is applied as 
appropriate to the work being perfo rmed.  Some of the employee 
responsibilities are listed. 
 
1. Obey all signs/postings. 
 
2. Comply with all radiological and safety rules.  
 
3. Do not enter any radiological area  unless escorted.  If visiting a radiological 
area with an escort: 
 
a. obey the instructions of your escort.  
 
b. obtain and properly w ear dosimeters as instructed by procedure, 
Radiological Control pe rsonnel, or your escort. 
 
c. utilize ALARA techniques to control your exposure. 
 
4. Be alert for and report unus ual radiological situations. 
 
Unusual situations may include findi ng radioactive material outside a 
designated area or finding a comp romised radiological barrier. 
 
5. Know where and/or how to contact R adiological Control personnel in your 
work area. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 22 
6. Comply with emergency procedures for your work area. 
 
7. Keep exposures to radi ation and radioactive mate rials ALARA and know the 
Administrative Control Levels and Dose Limits. 
 
8. Know your cumulative and annual dose. 
 
H. Monitoring (Dosimetry)  
 
Since radiation cannot  be detected with the human senses, special detection 
devices must be used.  Workers should become familiar with the equipment and devices used to measure and detect r adiation and radioactive material, 
as applicable to their job functions.  M onitoring is only required if you are likely 
to receive a dose in excess of 100 millirem in a year.  Therefor e, it is possible 
based on your job function and location that you will not be provided a 
dosimeter. 
 
(Insert facility-specific information) 
 
Some workers are monitored for intakes of radioactive material (e.g., inhaling 
or ingesting radioactive material).  Th is is typically done by either using an 
apparatus (e.g., whole body counter) to det ect the material in the body or by 
analyzing a sample the individua l provides (e.g., urinalysis). 
 
 I.  Exposure Reports  (EO6)  
 DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 23Although DOE and DOE cont ractor employees who are only trained at the 
GERT level are not expected to receive occupational dose above the monitoring threshold, they may be monito red for exposure in any case.  This 
could occur during escorted entries into radiologically controlled areas or in 
other circumstances.  I ndividuals who are monito red for exposure at DOE 
facilities have the right to request r eports of that exposure as follows: 
 
  • Upon the request from an indivi dual terminating employment, records 
of radiation exposure dose shall be provided by the DOE facility within 90 
days.  If requested, a written estimate  of radiation exposure received by 
the terminating employee shall be prov ided at the time of termination. 
 
  • Each individual who is required to  be monitored for radiation exposure 
at a DOE facility shall receive a r eport of that exposure on an annual 
basis. 
 
Note: As previously discussed, indivi duals may be monitored with a dosimeter 
even though they are not r equired to be monitored.  In this case an annual 
report is not required to be sent. 
 
  • Detailed information concerning any  individual’s exposure shall be 
made available to the individual upon request of that individual. 
 
  • When a DOE contractor is r equired to report to the Department, 
pursuant to Departmental requirem ents for occurrence reporting and 
processing, any exposure of an individ ual to radiation and/or radioactive 
material, or planned special exposure, the contractor shall also provide 
that individual with a report on his/her  exposure data included therein.  DOE-HDBK-1131-2007  
 
General Employee Radiological Training Student’s Guide  
 
 24Such a report shall be transmitted at a ti me not later than t he transmittal to 
the Department.

 25III. SUMMARY  
 
It is important to understand what radiati on and radioactive materials are and to 
recognize the postings associated with radiological work.  All employees are 
responsible to comply with the safety rules and to access only areas they are 
authorized to enter.  Through an enhanced awareness of this topic, each 
employee may contribute to safe practices in the workplace. DOE-HDBK-1131-2007

1 Introduction 
 
Purpose and Scope  This program management guide provides guidance for proper 
implementation of training as outlined in DOE-STD-1098-99, 
Radiological Control ( RCS). The guide is meant to assist those 
individuals, Department of Energy (DOE) employees, Managing and Operating (M&O) contractors, and Managing and Integrating (M&I) contractors identified as having responsibility 
for implementing the training recommended by the RCS. 
Facilities should determine the applicability of this material to 
support existing programs meant to comply with the training required by 10 CFR 835. Facilities are encouraged to revise these materials as appropriate. 
 
Management Guide Content  The management guide is divided into the following sections: 
o Introduction. 
o Instructional Materials Development. 
o Training Program Standards and Policies. 
o Course-Specific Information. 
 
Training Goal  The goal of this training program is to provide a  baseline 
knowledge for those individuals completing the training. Completion of the training provides personnel with the information necessary to perform their assigned duties at a predetermined level of expertise. 
 
Organizational Relationships The DOE Office of Worker Safety and Health Policy  
and Reporting Structure (DOE HS-11) is responsible for approving and  maintaining the 
training materials. The establishment of a comprehensive and effective contractor site radiol ogical safety training program is 
the responsibility of line management and their subordinates. 
The training function can be performed by a separate training organization, but the responsib ility for quality and effectiveness 
rests with the line management.  
 
Instructional Materials Development Next    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
    
2 Instructional Materials Development 
Target Audience  Course instructional materials were developed for specific 
employees who are responsible for knowing or using the 
knowledge or skills for each course. With this in mind, the 
participant should never ask the question, "Why do I need to learn this?" However, this question is often asked when the participant cannot apply the content of the program. It is the responsibility of management to select and send workers to training who need the content of the program. When workers can 
benefit from the course, they can be motivated to learn the 
content and apply it on their jobs . Care should be taken to read 
the course descriptions along with the information about who should attend. Participants a nd DOE facilities alike will not 
benefit from workers attending training programs unsuitable for 
their needs. 
 
Prerequisites  A background and foundation of  knowledge facilitates the 
trainee in learning new knowledge or skills. It is much easier to learn new material if it can be connected or associated to what 
was previously learned or experienced. Curriculum developers 
who have been involved in preparing instructional materials for the additional standardized training know this and have established what is referred to as "prerequisites" for each course. Certain competencies or experiences of participants were also identified as necessary prior to participants attending a course. 
Without these competencies or experiences, participants would 
be at a great disadvantage and could be easily discouraged and possibly fail the course. It is not fair to the other participants, the unprepared participant, and the instructor to have this misunderstanding.

3 Instructional Materials Development (continued) 
Training Materials  Training materials for the training program consist of a program 
management guide, an instructor’s  guide, a student’s guide, and 
overhead transparencies. This material is designed to be 
supplemented with updated or f acility-specific information.  
 
Supplemental material and traini ng aids may be developed to 
address facility-specific radiological concerns and to suit individual training styles. Refe rences are cited in each lesson 
plan and may be used as a resource in preparing facility-specific 
information and training aids.   Each site is responsible for est ablishing a method to differentiate 
the facility-specific information from the standardized lesson 
plan material. When additional or facility-specific information is 
added to the text of the lesson plan material, a method should be used to differentiate site inform ation from standardized material. 
 
Training Delivery  Sites are encouraged to expand and enhance the training 
materials through advanced training technologies. Computer-
based training and multimedia are samples of such technologies. 
 
Exemptions  Qualified personnel can be exempt ed from training if they have 
satisfactorily completed training programs (i.e., facility, college or university, military, or vendor programs) comparable in 
instructional objectives, content, and performance criteria. 
Documentation of the applicable and exempted portions of training should be maintained. 
 
Training Program Standards and Policies Next    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
    
4 Training Program Standards and Policies 
Qualification of Instructors  The technical instructor plays a ke y role in the safe and efficient 
operation of DOE facilities. Worker s must be well qualified and 
have a thorough unders tanding of the facility's operation, such as 
processing, handling, and storage of materials, and maintenance of equipment. Workers must know how to correctly perform their duties and why they are doing them. They must know how their actions influence other worker's responsibilities. Because workers' actions are so critical to their own safety and the safety 
of others, their trainers must be of the highest caliber. The 
technical instructor must understand thoroughly all aspects of the subjects being taught and the relationship of the subject content to the total facility. Additionally, the instructor must have the skills and knowledge to employ the instructional methods and 
techniques that will enhance learning and successful job 
performance. While the required technical and instructional qualifications are listed separately, it is the combination of these two factors that produces a qualified technical instructor. 
 
The qualifications are based on the best industry practices that 
employ performance-based instruction and quality assurances. These qualifications are not intended to be restrictive, but to help ensure that workers receive the highest-quality training possible. 
This is only possible when t echnical instructors possess the 
technical competence and instructional skills to perform assigned 
instructional duties in a manner that promotes safe and reliable 
DOE facility operations. 
 
Technical Qualifications  Instructors must possess technical competence (theoretical and 
practical knowledge along with work experience) in the subject 
areas in which they conduct training. The foundation for 
determining the instructor's technical qualifications is based on two factors: 
 
o The trainees being instructed. 
o The subject being presented. 
 
The following is an example of a target audience, the subject 
being taught, and instructor technical qualifications.

Technical Qualifications 
(continued) 
 
 
 
 
   
 
     
Methods for verifying the appropriate level of technical 
competence may include the review of prior training and education, observation and eval uation of recent related job 
performance, and oral or written examination. Other factors that 
may be appropriate for consideration include DOE, NRC, or 
other government license or certification; vendor or facility certification; and most importantl y, job experience. To maintain 
technical competence, a technical instructor should continue to perform satisfactorily on the job and participate in continuing technical training.

6 Training Program Standards and Policies (continued) 
Instructional Capability and Qualifications of instructional capability should be based  
Qualifications on demonstrated performance of the instructional tasks  for the 
specific course requirements and the instructor's position. 
Successful completion of instructor training and education programs, as well as an evaluation of on-the-job performance, is necessary for verification of  instructional capability. 
Instructional capability qualification should be granted at the successful completion of an approved professional development 
program for training instructors. The program should contain 
theory and practice of instructi onal skills and techniques, adult 
learning, planning, conducting, and evaluating classroom, simulator, laboratory, and on-the-job training activities as applicable to the facility or position.  
 
Illustrated talks, demonstrati ons, discussions, role playing, case 
studies, coaching, and indivi dual projects and presentations 
should be used as the principal instructional methods for presenting the instructional training program. Each instructional 
method should incorporate the applicable performance-based 
principles and practices. Every e ffort should be made to apply 
the content to actual on-the-job experience or to simulate the content in the classroom/laboratory. The appropriate methodology required to present the instructional content will indicate a required level of instructional qualification and skill. 
 
Current instructors' training, education, and job performance should be reviewed to determine their training needs for particular courses. Based on this review, management may provide exemptions based on de monstrated proficiency in 
performing technical instructor's tasks.

Instructional Capability and Through training or experience, technical instructors  
Qualifications (continued) should be able to: 
o Review instructional materials and modify to fully meet the 
needs of the training group. 
 
o Arrange the training facility (classroom/laboratory or other 
instructional setting) to meet the requirements for the training sessions.  
o Effectively communicate, verbally and non-verbally, lessons 
to enhance learning.  
o Invoke student interaction through questions and student 
activity. 
 
o Respond to students’ questions.

8 Training Program Standards and Policies (continued) 
Selection of Instructors  Selection of instructors should be based on the technical and 
instructional qualifications specified in the Course-Specific 
Information section of this guide . In addition to technical and 
instructional qualifications, or al and written communication 
skills, and interpersonal skills, should be included in the process of selecting and approving instructors. 
 
Since selection of instructors is an important task, those who 
share in the responsibility for ensuring program effectiveness 
should: 
 
o Interview possible instructors to ensure they understand 
the importance of the roles and responsibilities of 
technical instructors and are willing to accept and fulfill 
their responsibilities in a professional manner. 
 
o Maintain records of previous training, education, and 
work experience. Procedures for program evaluation will 
include documentation of providing qualified instructors 
for generic and facility-specific training programs. 
 
Test Administration  A test bank of questions for each course that has an exam should 
be developed and content validated. As the test banks are used, statistical validation of the test bank should be performed to fully 
refine the questions and make the tests as effective as possible. 
The questions contained in the test bank are linked directly to the objectives for each course. In th is way, trainee weaknesses can 
be readily identified and remedial procedures can be put into place. The test outcomes can also be used to document 
competence and the acquisition of knowledge. 
 
Continued on Next Page    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
    
9 Training Program Standards and Policies (continued)  
Test Administration The test banks should also be used by the instructors to  
(continued) identify possible weaknesses in the instruction. If  numerous 
trainees fail to correctly answer a valid set of questions for an 
objective, the instruction for that  objective needs to be reviewed 
for deficiencies.  
 Written examinations may be used to demonstrate satisfactory completion of theoretical classroom instruction. The following 
are some recommended minimal requirements for the test banks 
and tests: 
 
o Tests are randomly generated from the test bank. 
 
o Test items represent all objectives in the course. 
 
o All test bank items are content validated by a subject matter 
expert. 
 
o Test banks are secured and are not released either before or 
after the test is administered. 
 
o Trainees should receive feedback on their test performance. 
 
o Test banks should undergo statistical analyses. 
 
o For the first administrations of tests, a minimum of 80% 
should be required for a passing score. As statistical analyses of test results are performed, a more accurate percentage for a passing score should be identified. 
 
Test administration is critical in accurately assessing the trainee's acquisition of knowledge being tested. Generally the following rules should be followed: 
 
Continued on Next Page    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
    
10 Training Program Standards and Policies (continued) 
Test Administration 
(continued) 
o Tests should be announced at the beginning of the training 
sessions. 
 
o Instructors should continuously monitor trainees during 
examinations. 
 
o All tests and answers should be collected at the conclusion 
of each test. 
 
o No notes can be made by trainees concerning the test items. 
 
o No talking (aside from ques tions) should be allowed. 
 
o Answers to questions during a test should be provided, but 
answers to test items should not be alluded to or otherwise provided.  
o Where possible, multiple versions of each test should be 
produced from the test bank for each test administration. 
 
o After test completion, trainees may turn in their materials 
and leave the room while other trainees complete their tests.  
o Trainee scores on the tests should be held as confidential. 
 
Continued on Next Page  
    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
    
11 Training Program Standards and Policies (continued) 
Program Records and Training records and documentation shall meet the  
Administration requirements of 10 CFR 835.704 
 
Training Program All requests for program changes and revisions should  
Development/Change be sent to DOE using the “Document Improvement 
Requests Proposal (DOE F1300.3) form provided with each DOE 
Standard. 
 
Audit (internal and external)  Internal verification of training effectiveness should be 
accomplished through senior instructor or supervisor observation of practical applications and discussions of course material. All results should be documented and maintained by the organization responsible for Radiological Control training. The 
additional standardized training program materials and processes 
should be evaluated on a periodic basis by DOE-HQ. The evaluation should include a comparison of program elements with applicable industry standards and requirements. 
 
Evaluating Training Program Verification of the effectiveness of Radiological Control  
Effectiveness training should be accomplished per DOE-HDBK-1130-98, 
Radiological  Worker Training , Program Management Guide. In 
addition, DOE has issued guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of radiological training through the DOE Operations Offices and DOE Field Offices. For additional 
guidance, refer to DOE STD 1070-94, “Guide for Evaluation of 
Nuclear Facility Training Programs.”

12 Course-Specific Information 
Purpose  This section of the program management guide is to assist those 
individuals assigned responsi bility for implementing the 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities.  
 
Course Goal  Upon completion of this training, the student will have a basic 
understanding of the characteristics of uranium and the precautions needed for working in an uranium facility, which typically would include uranium fuel cycle facilities or areas 
contaminated with or storing uranium, or sites involved in 
cleanup programs. 
 
Target Audience  Individuals who have been assigned duties in uranium facilities. 
These individuals, depending on their job responsibilities, 
typically would include Radiological Workers. Depending on the 
facility, portions of the material may be applicable to General Employees and/or Radiological Control Technicians. 
 
Course Description  This course illustrates and rein forces the skills and knowledge 
needed to provide personnel with an understanding of the 
characteristics of uranium and the precautions needed for working in a DOE uranium facility. This course is developed in accordance with Article 662 of the RCS. The course material 
may be useful in developing and providing the facility specific portion of existing standardized core training, especially 
Radiological Worker Training. 
 
Prerequisites  This training material is designed to augment the DOE 
Radiological Worker core training. This course includes Radiological Worker training material but is not intended to 
replace Radiological Worker training. It is recommended that 
students complete Radiological Worker II training prior to receiving this course, if their job responsibilities require such training. Otherwise, Radiological Worker I training is recommended as a prerequisite. 
 
Length  4 - 8 hours (depending on facility-specific information).

Uranium 
 
 A.  Objective 
EO1 Describe the physical, radioactive, toxicological, and chemical properties and biological effects of uranium. 
 B.  Physical Properties   
Uranium can be encountered as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on its chemical form and surrounding conditions. Each of these physical forms has particular hazards. Sometimes, changing the form of uranium can lead to radioactive decay products accumulating or becoming concentrated in a particular location, such as on the surface of a liquid. The result can be an apparent increase in the radioactivity.  1.  Solid  
The solid forms of uranium are generally the most stable configurations. The shiny, silvery metal form is rarely seen except in a workshop when it is being machined. After machining, the surface oxidizes, typically within hours, to a hard, black surface.  After some time, depending on temperature, humidity, and alloy, the surface may change color and begin to flake. Orange or yellow colored surfaces are usually more 
flaky and soluble. In these forms, 
contamination can be more easily spread, inhaled, and absorbed into the body.

 2.  Liquid 
 
Uranium melts at 1133°C, so 
molten uranium is unusual, except 
in a foundry. It has often been observed that the radioactivity appears to increase when uranium is melted. This is because radioactive decay products, such as radium and thorium, float to the surface. The density of radium is 5 g/cm
3, 
compared with 19 g/cm3 for 
uranium; therefore, radium floats in molten uranium.  Uranium in contact or solution with water is common. The primary hazards associated with a uranium solution are criticality (for enriched uranium) and spills. Water decreases the quantity of enriched uranium required for criticality. This topic will be discussed in Module 105 – Criticality Safety. 
 3.  Airborne Powder 
 A spill of any radioactive solution is a concern. As the solution evaporates, it leaves behind a radioactive residue, or powder, that can easily become airborne. Airborne uranium may be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs. 
 4.  Gas 
 Another form of uranium that is an inhalation hazard is the volatile UF
6, becoming a gas above 56°C. 
However, most uranium daughters are not volatile, and so can  
   Provide a facility 
specific 
example of uranium in liquid form.                    Provide a facility specific example of uranium in airborne powder form.       Provide a facility specific example of uranium in gaseous form.    DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

 7 accumulate in storage cylinders. 
When the volatile UF 6 is extracted, 
the nonvolatile daughters remain in the cylinder, resulting in the buildup of residual radioactivity. 
However, in the case of uranium-
232 (
232U), uranium-235 (235U), and 
uranium-238 (238U), each of these 
uranium isotopes has a radon daughter. Radon is a gas at all but very low temperatures; therefore, if the radon escapes, the subsequent daughters can accumulate in closed or poorly ventilated areas.   In some situations, pressure from volatilized UF
6 gas can build up in 
small volumes such as a sealed container or a pipe run between two valves. Line breaks and leaks will cause a release of the UF
6. UF 6 
reacts in moist air to produce hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas. This gas is extremely corrosive and can severely damage the eyes, skin and lungs.  Also, as the escaping UF
6 
gas cools, it becomes particulate, which may have a suffocating effect on any nearby workers.   Another reason for pressure buildup is alpha particles emitted in radioactive decay eventually becoming inert helium gas. The amount is only significant for high specific activity forms of uranium. For example, a sample of 99% 
uranium- 233 ( 233U) with 1% 
232U creates approximately its own 
volume of helium gas every year.    Sealed containers must include adequate gas space or be fitted with pressure release valves. Once the

 8 pressure is relieved, the low-
pressure helium gas is harmless. 
 Hydrogen gas is generated from uranium in water, and this may also produce a 
pressure buildup situation. Because the 
hydrogen buildup may also be a fire hazard, it is discussed later in this module in the Chemical Properties section. 
 C.  Radioactive Properties - Uranium in its 
pure metal form is a silvery, gray metal and is the heaviest naturally occurring element. There are 18 separate isotopes of uranium. Isotopes are elements that have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons. For 
example, 235U has 92 protons with 143 
neutrons and 238U has 92 protons with 
146 neutrons.  Uranium is radioactive. Partially because of its size, the nucleus of a uranium atom is unstable. It reduces  its size either by 
alpha particle emission or by nuclear fission, in which the uranium nucleus splits, primarily, into two smaller fission products. Both proces ses release energy, 
which can be helpful or harmful depending on how they are controlled.  All isotopes of uranium are fissionable, which means they can be fissioned by 
fast neutrons. Two isotopes, 233U and 
235U, are fissile, which means they can 
also be fissioned by slow (thermal) neutrons. A fissile material can be involved in a criticality accident, resulting in the release of a lethal amount of radiation. Criticality is discussed in more detail in Module 105- Criticality Safety.

 9 The primary isotopes of uranium are all 
long-lived alpha emitters. However, several other radionuclides can be radiologically significant at uranium facilities, depending on the history of the 
uranium materials and the processing. 
These other radionuclides include the 
following beta emitters: 234Th, 234m Pa, 
231Th, and 99Tc. The degree of 
enrichment also affects the controls that are required for external radiation exposure because of the increase in the 
amount of gamma-emitting 235U that is 
present. The uranium daughter products may also include some low energy gamma and x-ray radiation. For example, 
the daughter products of 232U represent 
a potential gamma emission hazard. 
 
Although there are several isotopes of uranium, only three exist naturally, and all three are radioactive. See the table below for half-lives and natural percent abundance for important uranium isotopes in the nuclear fuel cycle.

As uranium goes through radioactive 
decay, it produces other radioactive 
elements known as radioactive decay products (also called progeny or daughter 
products). These radioactive decay 
products are also radioactive and have to be taken into account for radiological protection purposes.  Both alpha and beta particles are emitted as part of decay series. For example, 238U decays by alpha emission to  
234Th; 234Th decays by beta emission to  
234m Pa; and so on, until stable 206Pb is 
finally reached. 
 
1.  Decay Series 
 
Uranium has two naturally occurring decay series: the 
“actinium” series, which has  235U 
as its parent; and the “uranium” 
series, which has 238U as its 
parent. Many of our everyday encounters with radioactivity come from these decay series; examples are radon gas and radium.  There are also man-made isotopes 
of uranium -  232U and  233U. These 
radionuclides and their decay products must be considered in the implementation of a radiological control program at a facility where these uranium nuclides are present. 
 2.  Criticality 
 
Uranium is a fissionable material, which means it can undergo nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is a process in which a very heavy, unstable atom splits in two, or “fissions”. When an atom fissions, one Show OT-6

smaller atoms, between one and seven neutrons are given off which may cause fission in nearby atoms), and a great deal of energy is given off as radiation and in 
other forms, such as kinetic energy of the 
fission fragments. The radiation created could result in the cr eation of radiological 
areas, such as High or Very High Radiation Areas. Nuclear criticality associated with uranium will be discussed in greater detail later in the 
lesson. 
 D.  Chemical Properties  
Uranium is chemically reactive. It burns in air like magnesium; it is toxic like lead; and it forms a large variety of chemical compounds. All the isotopes of uranium have the same chemical reactivity, and all can be made into the many different physical and chemical forms discussed in this section. 
 
1.  Fire  
Uranium is a metal that will sustain a burning reaction (similar to a magnesium flare). The potential for a fire is greatest when the uranium is in a finely divided form, such as milling chips or filings. In this form, uranium can undergo spontaneous ignition. Uranium metal is often machined to provide a useful end product, and milling chips and filings are unavoidable byproducts.   Precautions must be taken to prevent chips and filings from igniting. One precaution is submersing the chips and filings in water or a mineral oil. Storage in

Module 101 Properties of Uranium 
L e s s o n  P l a n        I n s t r u c t o r ’ s  N o t e s   
 13 water produces hydrogen gas due to 
a chemical reaction. To prevent the hydrogen gas from reaching an explosive concentration, and to prevent a pressure buildup, 
containers must be vented. 
Incidents have occurred where container lids have  been blown off 
by unexpected gas pressure buildup.  The use of water or oil baths for collecting and storing chips needs to be evaluated for criticality safety concerns before put into practice.  Once uranium starts to burn, it is extremely difficult to extinguish. None of the typical extinguishing methods, such as water, carbon dioxide, or halon, is effective in fighting uranium fires. In fact, halon may be explosive and produce toxic fumes if used directly on the fire.  Normally, small fires may be put out by using MET-L-X powder, which is a mixture of sodium chloride (table salt) and potassium carbonate (baking powder). When spread over the burning metal in significant quantities, MET-L-X starves the fire of oxygen.  Larger fires, such as with storage drums, are more difficult to extinguish. Submersion in water will eventually work once the metal cools down. However, continuous water addition is necessary to make up for losses due to boiling and evaporation.  
2.  Toxicological/Biological Effects 
 
The principal entry of uranium into  
    
 
                        The Chernobyl explosion resulted in a graphite reactor core fire that burned for days.     Show OT-9       DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
 
Module 101 Properties of Uranium 
L e s s o n  P l a n        I n s t r u c t o r ’ s  N o t e s   
 14 the human system is due to either 
inhalation or ingestion. Inhalation occurs either from release of volatile uranium compound or from suspension of volatile uranium-
laden aerosols. Ingestion can occur 
when the uranium is introduced into water for consumption or the food chain by plant uptake. When uranium is either ingested or inhaled, it is removed from the body with a biological half-life varying between 6 and 5000 days, depending on which organ has become contaminated. Uranium tends to concentrate in the kidneys and the bones. Additionally, if inhaled, the lungs are exposed. Internal exposure to uranium is controlled by limiting the ingestion and inhalation of this element. These methods, along with measurement techniques, are discussed in Module 104.  Most heavy metals, such as uranium, are toxic to humans depending on the amount introduced into the body. For short-term (acute) exposures, the toxicological effects are the primary concern, and acute exposures to significant amounts of uranium may result in kidney damage. However, as the enrichment of the uranium in the 
235U isotope increases, so too do 
the effects of radiation exposure in relation to toxicological effects.   Past industrial experience has proven that if there is a long-term exposure of small amounts of uranium (chronic exposure), the radiological effects are the primary biological concern. In fact, for

 15 chronic exposures, a development 
of tolerance against the toxicological effects may occur. The principal radiological hazard associated with uranium is due to 
the relatively high energy alpha 
particles its radionuclides and daughters emit. A chronic exposure to these radionuclides result in an increased risk of cancer, typically in the bones, kidney, and lungs, since these are the organs where uranium is deposited. 
 
3.  Chemical Reactivity  
 
The chemistry of uranium is complicated. For example, uranium forms several oxides: UO, UO
2 
UO 3, and UO 4. In general, a sample 
of uranium oxide will include a mixture of several of these. For example, U
3O8 is sometimes written 
as (UO 2)•2(UO 3). 
 
The lower oxidation states, UO 2 
and U 3O8, tend to be dark brown or 
black. The higher oxidation states, UO
3 and UO 4, are generally orange 
or yellow, especially in solution or if water or crystallization are 
present (e.g., UO
4•2H2O). 
Furthermore, the higher oxides 
usually flake of more easily and are usually more soluble in water. Being flaky, they are more easily inhaled. Being more soluble, they are more easily absorbed into the body.  Uranyl compounds, such as uranyl nitrate, or UO
2(NO3) 2, are chemical 
forms of uranium that are often found in solution with water. They are generally yellow in color and

 16 are used in criticality experiments.  
 Uranium reacts readily with air and water. For example, when uranium is machined, small chips catch fire 
from the heat of the machining 
process. Shavings placed in water react to produce hydrogen gas. The surfaces quickly oxidize to a hard black coating that is at first protective; however, under adverse conditions, it corrodes and flakes.  Uranium also reacts with hydrogen or tritium gas to form uranium hydride (UH
3). Uranium “beds” are 
commonly used to store tritium.  Uranium hexafluoride (UF
6) reacts 
in moist air to produce hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, which is extremely corrosive and can severely damage the lungs if breathed. Inhalation of HF has resulted in fatalities following UF
6 
releases.   The chemical form of uranium is dependent on its intended use and its stage of production. For example, UF
6 is used during the 
enrichment process, and UO 2 is 
used as nuclear fuel. When handling uranium compounds, the possibility of chemical reactions must not be overlooked.

 B.  Importance of Uranium  
Uranium is a naturally occurring element used primarily for producing energy with nuclear reactors and developing nuclear weapons. It is 
also used for armor plating (depleted uranium), radiation shielding, and counterweights.  Historically, uranium was used for hundreds of years to color glass and as a glaze for tile and pottery. Bright orange “Fiesta-ware” dinner plates were prized for their color without any awareness of  their radioactivity. 
These plates are no longer produced, but are now collectors’ items among those in the nuclear industry and others. Typically, the dose rate is about 5 mrem/hr (0.05 mSv/hr) on contact with these plates.  The original discovery of radioactivity involved uranium. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium would cause photographic film to become fogged because of radioactive emissions. Some of these emissions were even more penetrating that the “X rays” that Wilhelm Roentgen had discovered a year earlier.

 18 Module 102 The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
Later investigators, such as Marie Curie, 
isolated other radioactive elements from uranium ores. These elements are produced from the radioactive decay of uranium. The radioactive emission of an  alpha particle causes 
uranium to change into thorium. Thorium goes on to decay to other elements, and so on, until a stable element such as lead is reached.  Radium and radon are the two most well-known radioactive decay products of uranium. Radium was once used for luminous instrument dials and other products. Radon is a heavy 
radioactive gas that can accumulate in 
buildings and mines. Typically, these radioactive decay products are more hazardous than the uranium itself.  The importance of uranium increased dramatically with the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938, the production of plutonium in 1940, and the construction of the first reactor in 1942 under the direction of Enrico Fermi. These accomplishments led to the Manhattan Project, in which uranium was enriched at Oak Ridge or converted into  plutonium at Hanford. 
These products were used to assemble the first atomic bombs at Los Alamos in 1945.  After the end of Worl d War II in 1945, the 
importance of uranium remained high. Production of uranium and plutonium for “atomic” or “nuclear” weapons continued throughout the Cold War. In addition, nuclear reactors were built for the propulsion of naval submarines and ships, and for the commercial production of electricit y. Now, most of the 
world’s production of uranium is used for nuclear reactors.

 C.  Sources of Uranium  
Uranium is found in the earth's crust and is mined as ore. The average concentration is 2 parts per million (ppm) in the crust and less than 2 parts per billion (ppb) in the oceans. During the 1960's and 1970's, a program titled the Natural Uranium Resource Exploration was funded by the government to identify the locations of desirable uranium ore throughout the United States. It was determined that the most desirable locations of uranium are in the 
Colorado Plateau, the Wyoming Basin, and the 
flanks of the Black Hills in South Dakota. In those locations, the uran ium concentration is 
much higher than 2 ppm. Uranium is also found on the African Con tinent. The ore is 
removed from either shallow open pits (less than 300-foot, or100 m, depths) or underground mines (greater than 300-foot depths). The typical uranium content of the ore is 0.15 - 0.3 
percent and is in  the form of U
3O8, which is 
called "yellowcake.” Uranium is also found in secondary minerals in the following forms: complex oxides, silicates, phosphates, and vanadates. 
 D.  Uranium Operations and Processes  
Uranium processing is dependent upon the desired product, but it generally involves the following cycle: 
 
• mining and milling, • conversion, • enrichment, • fabrication, • use, • waste disposal/storage, and • decontamination and decommissioning.

1.  Uranium Mining and Milling 
 
After removal from the mine, the uranium ore is milled to extract the yellowcake. This involves the following process: 
 
a.  The ore is crushed, ground, and mixed 
with water to prepare for chemical processing. 
 
b.  The crushed ore and water mixture is 
mixed with chemicals to separate the 
yellowcake from the ore. This 
separation process is called "leaching.” The resultant products include a slurry of yellowcake ready for additional processing and a mixture of low-grade crushed rock and sand called "mill tailings.”  
 
Only about 3 percent of the actual material removed from the mine ends up a yellowcake, which means that millions of tons of mill tailings are leftover. 
   
 Show OT-17  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
 
Module 102 The Nuclear Fuel Cycle 
L e s s o n  P l a n        I n s t r u c t o r ’ s  N o t e s   
 21  
Yellowcake contains 70-90% by weight of uranium oxides. The leftover mill tailings are a concern because they still contain some of the uranium ore . Additional hazards exist due to the chemicals added. It is estimated that the uranium milling in the United States left approximately 138 million tons of mill tailings covering about 3,000 acres of land. 
 
c.  The yellowcake slur ry is then purified 
by either ion exchange or solvent 
extraction. 
 d.  Following purification, the 
yellowcake slurry is dried, forming a concentrated yellowcake compound that contains 75 – 98 percent uranium. The yellow color is caused by the addition of leaching chemicals and their eventual removal during the drying step. The final color can range from yellow to orange to black depending on the chemicals used and the drying temperature. 
 
The final color is a good indicator of solubility, and thus of biological effects if uranium in this form is taken into the body. Less soluble uranium 
compounds tend both to remain in the body longer and to be darker in color. More soluble uranium compounds are removed from the body more quickly by normal body functions, and tend to be lighter in color.

2.  Conversion 
 
At this stage in the nuclear fuel cycle, the yellowcake is converted into uranium hexafluoride (UF
6) for enrichment. This 
is accomplished by: 
 
a.  Conversion of yellowcake to pure 
uranium trioxide (UO 3), called 
"orange oxide" or "orange salt,” by solvent extraction and follow-up drying. 
 
b.  Conversion of UO
3 to uranium 
dioxide UO 2. 
 c.  Conversion of UO
2 to uranium 
tetrafluoride (UF 4) by 
hydrofluorination (addition of hydrogen fluoride gas). This product is called "green salt.” 
 
d.  Reacting the UF
4 with fluorine gas 
(F2) to form uranium hexafluoride 
(UF 6), which is a volatile form ready 
for enrichment. The UF 6 is a solid at 
room temperature but readily becomes a gas when heated above 56°C.

3.  Enrichment 
 
The enrichment process is necessary to 
increase the percentage of the 235U 
isotope in the uranium to make it suitable for reactor fuel. Natural uranium contains 
0.7% 235U. Typically, enriched uranium 
contains 2-4% 235U. Other uses may 
require much higher concentrations up to, 
or even greater than, 90% 235U. Depleted 
uranium, which is left over after the enrichment process, has an abundance of 
about 0.2% 235U. 
 
The methods used to enrich uranium include: 
 
a.  Gaseous Diffusion 
 
Gaseous diffusion is based on principles of gas laws. The UF
6 gas is 
forced through converters by large compressors. The converters contain many tubes made of a special barrier 
material that is porous. The 235UF
6 
molecules are lighter than the 238UF 6 
molecules and bounce against the porous barrier more frequently. The 235UF
6 has a greater chance of 
passing through the barrier, resulting 
in a slightly richer 235U content. It 
may take as many as a thousand passes to obtain the desired degree of enrichment.

b.  Laser Processes  
 
The Atomic Vaporization Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) involves vaporization, selec tive ionization of 
one isotope, and subsequent electrical separation. Currently, no DOE production plants exist which use this technology. 
 
c.  Nozzle Separation  
 
The nozzle separation process is 
based on the different speeds of 235U 
and 238U compounds when they are 
injected through a nozzle into a small chamber. 
 
d.  Centrifugal Separation  
 
Centrifugal separation is based on heavier compounds migrating to the outside when spun at a high rate of speed. The uranium left over from the 
enrichment process is mostly 238U, 
with a reduced amount of 235U 
(usually 0.2% by weight). This byproduct is called "depleted uranium" and has additional uses such as radiation shield ing, armor plating, 
and ammunition. 
 
During World War II, uranium work was secret and code names were used for the different forms of uranium. Natural uranium was named “Tuballoy,” a name that grew out of a cover story that the Allies were investigating alloys for high-quality tubing. 
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
 
Module 102 The Nuclear Fuel Cycle 
L e s s o n  P l a n        I n s t r u c t o r ’ s  N o t e s   
 25  
Highly enriched uranium was then named “Oralloy” for “Oak Ridge Alloy,” sometimes abbreviated to “Oy.” Depleted uranium was once called depletalloy, but more commonly was called “D-38” since it 
consists mostly of 238U. These 
historical names are sometimes still used within the DOE complex. 
 
4.  Fabrication 
 
The last step in the nuclear fuel cycle is 
changing the enriched uranium into an 
appropriate form fo r fabrication. The 
fabrication process differs depending on 
the application. For fabrication of fuel elements, the process generally includes the following steps. 
 
a.  Uranium dioxide (UO
2) is produced 
by reacting UF 6 with water and then 
with a hydroxide salt. 
 b.  The resulting preci pitate is dried to 
form "orange oxide," which is reduced with hydrogen to form UO
2 
powder. 
 
c.  The UO 2 powder is compacted into 
cylindrical pellets that are loaded into thin walled tubes made of either stainless steel or an  alloy of zirconium 
called "zircalloy.”

 26  
d.  Helium, an inert gas, is pumped into 
the tubes, which are then capped. A cluster of these tubes separated by spacers forms a reactor fuel assembly. 
 
Fabrication of other materials, such as weapons parts, may also include materials made with uranium. 
 
5.  Uses 
 
The primary goal of the uranium fuel cycle process is to yield enriched 
uranium. This product can be used for: 
 
•  power reactors, •  research reactors, •  nuclear weapons, and •  naval propulsion reactors. 
 
There are also a number of uses for uranium metal depleted in the 
235U 
isotope, such as: 
 
•  radiation shielding, •  armor-piercing bullets, •  catalysts for chemical reactions, •  armor plating, and •  counter weights.

Depleted uranium typically is cast into ingots or billets, and then shipped to production facilities for appropriate reshaping. 
 
6.  Reprocessing 
 
Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is no longer performed in this country. This information is provided for the purpose of describing how the process worked at applicable facilities.  
Uranium was used in plutonium 
production reactors. Uranium fuel and targets were coated with aluminum or zirconium metal and placed in the reactor. As they were irradiated with neutrons, a small fraction of the uranium was converted to plutonium. The irradiated fuel was then removed from the reactor, but the plutonium and uranium had to be separated from the fission products created during irradiation.  PUREX, a chemical process for plutonium and uranium extraction from irradiated nuclear fuel, was developed to accomplish this separation. This reprocessing was accomplished as follows:  a.  Excess metal was mechanically 
removed to expose the fuel material. 
 b.  The fuel was leached with acid to 
remove it from the cladding. 
 
c.  The uranium and other elements were 
separated by solvent extraction (chemical separation). 
 
d.  The uranium was converted back to 
UF
6 for enrichment.

7.  Waste Disposal and Storage 
 
Due to the remaining radioactive properties, the nuclear fuel cycle byproducts must be controlled and/or disposed. These byproducts can be divided into two categories—low-level waste (LLW) and high-level waste (HLW). 
 
a.  LLW 
 
The RCS glossary defines low-level 
waste (LLW) as “Waste that contains 
radioactivity and is not classified as 
high-level waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material as defined in Section 11e(2) of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended. Test specimens of fissionable material i rradiated only for 
research and development and not for production of power or plutonium may be classified as low-level waste provided the concentration of transuranic activity  is less than 100 
nCi/g.” LLW could be in the form of liquids, solids, or gasses. Liquid waste is usually processed to remove radioactive material and then recycled or disposed.

 29  
 Solids may be volume-reduced by incineration or compaction. Soluble forms in liquid may be solidified to isolate radioactive contents.  Gases are either changed to a solid form and disposed of as a solid or compressed and stored as gases. These gases may be released after sufficient time has elapsed for decay of the radioactive component of the 
gas. 
 
b.  HLW  
 
High-level waste (HLW) is defined in DOE M 435.1-1 as “The highly radioactive waste material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material 
derived from such liqui d waste that contains 
fission products in suffici ent concentrations; and 
other highly radioactiv e material that is 
determined, consistent with existing law, to require permanent isolation”.

 30  
HLW comes primarily from the reprocessing of spent fuel. It is typically in liquid form, and it is collected and stored in tanks. The liquid waste is then solidified (stabilized) for disposal. All HLW is ultimately to be disposed of by deep burial. 
 
8.  Decontamination and Decommissioning 
of Uranium Facilities 
 
Uranium and its byproducts from the 
nuclear fuel cycle may present health 
risks due to radioac tivity or chemical 
properties. Past and present DOE uranium facilities and their surrounding areas may 
contain contamination from uranium or its byproducts. DOE recognizes that they have a responsibility to restore these potentially contaminated facilities and surrounding areas to a non-hazardous condition. To accomplish this, several “remediation” programs are in place and others are developing. 
 
One cleanup program is:  Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Program 
   
      Show OT-24

 31  
This program is intended to cleanup uranium mill sites and associated “vicinity properties.” It covers 24 mill sites and more than 4,800 properties throughout the Nation. The goals of the program are to reduce radon release from mill tailings to acceptable levels by burial, and to restore affected land and facilities/structures to unrestricted use. 
 
Each cleanup project presents different types 
and levels of hazards to workers. 
Additionally, general sa fety hazards become 
a significant factor due to the types of processes and equipment used to remove the uranium-contaminated materials. Usually these projects require so me level of structural 
decontamination and soil remediation.

external exposure to uranium. 
EO5  Describe the meas ures taken to control

 B.  Alpha External Dose  
Because of the relatively short range of alpha particles in dense matter, alpha radiation poses little external dose haza rd. The most energetic 
alphas produced by naturally occurring radionuclides will barely  penetrate the dead 
layer of skin on the human body. Little living 
tissue will be affected when the alpha source is external to the skin. 
 C.  Beta External Dose   
Beta doses to the skin, extremities, and the lens of the eye can be limiting in facilities which process unshielded depleted, natural, or low-enrichment uranium. Processes which separate and sometimes concentrate beta-emitting uranium daughters are not uncommon in DOE uranium facilities. Control of exposure is complicated by the fact that considerable contact work takes place in facilities which process uranium metal.

 33 Module 103 External Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
Several uranium radioactive decay products are beta emitters. Normally, most of these betas are shielded by the surrounding material or material worn as personal protective clothing (such as Tyvek). A primary radionuclide of concern is protactinium-234 in its 
metastable state ( 234m Pa), a daughter of 
238U which produces a very high energy 
beta particle that can travel up to 20 feet in air. Significant beta radiation is also 
emitted from 234Th (also a daughter of 
238U) and 231Th (a daughter of 235U). 
Typically, these are shielded with ½-inch of plastic. 
 
D.  Gamma and X-Ray External Dose  
 
Although beta dose from unshielded uranium presents the most common radiation problem, storage of large quantities of uranium can create low-level gamma radiation fields (less than 5 
mrem/hr). Such fields can create external 
exposure problems, particularly when significant numbers of people are working in adjacent areas.  In addition to gamma emissions from the 
uranium decay chains ( 238U and 235U), 
recycled fuel materials introduced back into the enrichment process will result in higher gamma radiation fields because of 228Th, a gamma-emitting daughter of 
232U with a relatively short half-life (1.9 
yr).  
Larger sources of gamma radiation may exist from specific uranium processes, including unflushed UF6 cylinders. Gamma radiation emitted from residual  Discuss all other 
beta emitters of importance at your facility.            Show OT-27

 34 Module 103 External Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
materials can result in gamma radiation fields of several hundred millirem per hour. This problem can be controlled by flushing empty cylinders to remove residual material. 
 
E.  Neutron External Dose 
 
As uranium is processed in the fuel cycle, it is often chemically bonded to fluorine to create compounds such as UF
4 and 
UF 6. When uranium atoms in these 
compounds decay, they emit alpha particles that are sometimes captured by the neighboring fluorine atoms. The resulting atom is unstable and may emit a neutron to gain back its stability. The neutrons emitted can result in neutron radiation fields between 4 and 8 mrem/h.  The probability of spontaneous fission is small; therefore exposure is not expected. However, if fission does occur, such as in 
a reactor or from experiments, the neutron 
radiation is typically contained. Neutron radiation that is not contained is usually 
the result of a critic ality accident, which 
generates potentially fatal doses of gamma radiation. 
 
F.  External Dose Measurements 
 
The radiation from uranium that affects external dose includes beta, gamma, X-ray and neutron irradiation. An effective external exposure control program for uranium requires a variety of radiation detection instruments that are responsive to these forms of radiation. Radiation surveys should be performed on a routine basis and during events, tasks, procedures, or situations  that are likely to

Notes 
cause radiological conditions to change. There are two general categories of measurement used for external exposure associated with uranium, portable survey instruments and personnel dosimeters.  Gamma radiation from uranium is normally not the controlling problem. For example, the contact beta radiation field from depleted uranium is approximately 240 millirem per hour, while the contact gamma radiation field is less than 10 millirem per hour. However, significant gamma fields can exist in areas where large quantities of uranium are stored, such as a storage area for uranium contaminated soil. The accuracy and precision of survey instruments used for measurement of beta radiation fields depend on many factors which must be addressed, such as energy response and geometry factors. Accordingly, these surveys are typically conducted by 
Radiological Control personnel. Neutron 
fields from enriched uranium fluoride compounds can also add to this area of concern. Depending on the magnitude of neutron fields generate d, periodic neutron 
dose rate measurements are made, typically by Radiological Control personnel.  Personnel dosimeters produce the data which becomes the formal or “legal” record of personnel exposure, thermoluminescent dosimeters, used in most DOE uranium facilities, provides the most accurate and precise means of measuring doses received by workers.

G.  External Dose Reduction and Control 
Techniques 
 
1.  External Dose Control Program 
 
The primary purpose of an external dose control program is to  control dose to the 
individual radiation worker to below regulatory limits and administrative levels and ensuring that doses are As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). In all cases at DOE facilities, dose received by an individual shall not exceed the limits specified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 835 (10 CFR 835). 
 
The elements of an external dose control program include: 
 
•  detecting and char acterizing the beta, 
gamma, X-ray, and neutron radiation fields; 
•  measuring and/or quantifying these 
radiation fields; 
•  measuring personnel exposure; and •  determining extern al exposure control 
practices.  
2.  General External Dose Control Practices  
 These general principles should be 
applied to control  external dose from uranium: 
 •  minimizing time in the radiation field,  •  maximizing the distance from the 
radiation source, 
•  using shielding to reduce the radiation 
field, and 
•  reducing the amount of radioactive 
material being used.

Notes 
3.  Specific Beta Dose Control Principles  
 
Surfaces emitting beta radiation are easily 
shielded with plastic or other light element materials. Use of denser materials for shielding of high-energy beta radiation may produce bremsstrahlung X-rays and should be avoided.  Beta dose to the lens of the eye can be reduced by using safety glasses. Safety glasses are commonly wo rn for industrial 
safety concerns in ar eas where uranium is 
handled. Heavy rubber or leather gloves are effective in reducing the skin dose to the hand, but their use must be balanced against other safety concerns, such as hazards from machinery or loss of manual dexterity.   
Industrial safety concerns in a uranium facility may be more hazardous to personnel than 
exposure to radiation. Pr ofessional radiological 
control personnel evaluate  the process in the 
workplace to ensure workers receive the maximum overall protection from all hazards, not only radiological hazard s. This is generally 
done in cooperation with industrial safety and industrial hygien e personnel.

 EO6  Identify the mode s of entry into the 
body for uranium. 
EO7  Describe the measures taken to 
control intakes of uranium, including special radiological surveys and techniques, instruments, and release of materials. 
 B.  Internal Exposure to Uranium   
As discussed in Module 101, the primary biological hazard is the potential for uranium to be taken into the body. This exposure may result in heavy metal poisoning, including kidney damage (for acute exposures), or an increased cancer risk (for chronic exposures). Uranium may enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, absorption through the 
skin, or injection into  the bloodstream, such 
as from contamination of an open wound.  The most common route of entry is inhalation, but much of the material inhaled does not stay in the lungs. The lungs and related air passages constantly work to remove all the dust we breathe, including dust that contains uranium. The dust expelled from the lungs but not exhaled is swallowed, so some of the inhaled uranium ends up in the digestive tract.

 39 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
The amount of uraniu m retained in the 
lungs depends a great deal on the size of the particle breathed. The smallest particles tend to be exhaled or absorbed into the bloodstream, while the largest particles are usually removed before they reach the lung. Uranium retained in the lungs may remain there or be absorbed into the bloodstream. Part of the uranium 
passing through the digestive tract may also be absorbed in the bloodstream. Uranium in the bloodstream is either transferred to various organs or excreted via the urine.  The enrichment of the uranium in its 235U isotope also plays a role in 
determining whether the radiological or the chemical effects are the limiting factor. For acute exposures, chemical toxicity is limiting up to 39% enrichment. Beyond 39%, the effective dose becomes limiting. For chronic exposures, chemical 
toxicity is more limiting up to 1.3% 
enrichment. Beyond 1.3%, the effective dose becomes limiting. 
 
C.  Internal Dose Measurements 
 
Once in the body, the presence of uranium can be detected using indirect radioactivity meas urements, direct 
radioactivity measur ements, or both. 
 
At one time, it was not possible to detect internal uptakes of uranium or certain 
other radioactive materials at levels below the point at which the annual limit for exposure (5 rem) was received. Any measurable intake of uranium was therefore considered to be unacceptable. Improved analytical and calculational techniques have now made it possible to

Bodily processes will, to some degree, eliminate uranium taken into the body. How effective the body is at eliminating the uranium, and how long the process takes, depends upon individual metabolism and the chemical form of the uranium. For example, uranium hexafluoride contains uranium that is chemically bound to fluorine and is more easily eliminated than uranium metal or uranium dioxide.  
Indirect measurements are made by 
sampling material eliminated by the body for the presence of uranium. It is possible to analyze both feces and urine for the presence of uranium, but due to the ease of collection and handling, the most common method used is urinalysis.  
2.  Direct or In Vivo Measurement 
 
Direct measurements are performed using whole body counters or lung counters. These instruments detect gamma and X-rays emitted from radioactive material  inside the body. 
For example, the 235U and uranium-
234 (
234U) isotopes of uranium 
present in enriched uranium emit X-rays that can be detected.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 41 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 Alpha and beta radiation emitted by material inside the body is shielded by body tissue and cannot be detected.  Direct measurement is useful for detecting uranium that is not easily eliminated by the body. This method may also be used to estimate an internal dose. Because of the very low energy and intensity of gamma radiation emitted from depleted uranium, direct measurements are not effective in detecting depleted uranium in the body. 
 
D.  Internal Dose Reduction and Control 
Techniques 
 
The hierarchy for minimization of internal dose is given in the RCS, Article 316. Engineering controls should be the primary method of minimizing airborne 
contamination and internal exposure to 
workers, where practicable.   Administrative contro ls, including access 
controls and specific work practices, should be used as the secondary method to minimize internal exposure. If the potential for airborne radioactivity still exists after engineering and administrative controls have been applied, respiratory protection should be considered. Other specific controls, such as stay times, worker safety, comfort, and efficiency, are also discussed in Article 316. 
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 42 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
The internal exposure resulting from uranium entering the body can be properly controlled by appropriate facility 
and equipment design, contamination control procedures, and protective clothing. A bioassay monitoring program to determine the amount of uranium taken into the body is also an integral part of 
internal exposure control. 
 
1.  Contamination Control Philosophy  
 
The control of contamination in the work place is a significant part of the overall radiological protection program at uranium facilities. Proper contamination control will:  •  limit internal exposure by 
minimizing the ingestion, inhalation, absorption, and injection of uranium; 
•  limit external dose from uranium 
and its radioactive decay products; 
and 
•  prevent the spread of radioactive 
materials into uncontrolled areas. 
 
2.  Contamination Control Methods  
 Because uranium is relatively less hazardous than some other radioactive materials, such as plutonium, some people can develop an overly relaxed attitude to uranium; in effect saying, “It’s only uranium.” 
 
Care must be taken to avoid this attitude, and to control uranium contamination in compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures.

Notes 
Uranium contamination can be effectively controlled by: 
 
•  an evaluation of activities likely to 
generate or spread contamination, 
•  use of containment devices to 
confine contamination as close to the source as possible, 
•  control and monitoring of airborne 
contamination as it is generated, 
•  minimizing the size and number 
of contaminated areas by using effective decontamination methods, 
•  control of movement of 
equipment and personnel into and out of contaminated areas, 
•  use of personal protective 
equipment, and 
•  effective contamination 
monitoring. 
 
a.  Evaluation of Work Activities 
 
Work activities that involve the destruction of surfaces, such as grinding, machining, filing, or cutting, can easily create and spread contamination. Operations such as welding, burning, heating, etc. can alter the physical and/or chemical state of uranium compounds that are on the surfaces of equipment. Work activities such as  these should be 
evaluated and steps taken to minimize the spread of surface contamination, personnel contamination, and airborne contamination. If possible, alternative methods for completing the task should be considered.

 44 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
b.  Use of Containment Devices  
 
Whenever activities that may generate loose contamination are planned, consideration should be given to using containment devices to control the contamination to an area as close to the source as possible. Such devices include glovebags, gloveboxes, and tents. 
 
c.  Control and Monitoring of 
Airborne Contamination 
 
Uranium contamination is relatively dense (heavy) so it is not easily stirred up into the air 
and quickly settles out when disturbed. Therefore, it is unlikely that significant airborne contamination will result from normal activities (such as 
walking) in areas contaminated 
with uranium. It is possible for airborne contamination to result from activity that vigorously disturbs the surface, such as sweeping, grinding, welding, and direct, high-volume air flow.

 45 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 
Failure to control airborne contamination could result in inhalation of the contamination and spread of contamination to other areas. 
 
Control of airborne contamination should include: 
 
•  an evaluation of activities 
that are likely to cause contamination to become airborne, 
•  engineered controls such as 
installed or portable ventilation with High Efficiency Particulate Air filtration systems (HEPA systems) to remove contamination from the air at a point as close to the source as possible, 
•  physical barriers (e.g., pipes, 
gloveboxes, etc) and pressure differential zones, 
•  use of alternate work 
activities or equipment that is less likely to generate airborne contamination, 
•  air sampling to track 
airborne contamination levels, and 
•  using respiratory protection 
to minimize internal dose of the worker. 
 
Monitoring for airborne contamination can take several forms:

Notes 
 
•  long-term, low-volume air 
samples that provide an average of the airborne concentration over a given time; 
•  short-duration, high-volume 
air samples taken in the breathing zone of a worker during work activities likely to generate airborne contamination; 
•  low-volume (about 2 liters 
per minute) breathing zone samples from personal air monitors; and [Note: A liter is approximately the same volume as a quart. Use the concept of a 2-liter soda bottle to describe the quantity.] 
•  continuous air monitors that 
track airborne contamination 
levels over time and can be 
set to alarm if a specified level is reached. 
 
It is important that air samples represent the actual airborne contamination levels breathed by the worker so that accurate intakes may be estimated. Air monitoring is also used to detect loss of containment. It is important to ensure sample volumes and methods allow detection of airborne contamination levels below the level of concern. 
 
  
Airborne contamination measurements may be described in terms of Derived Air Concentrations (DACs) in order to compare with regulatory limits. One DAC is the airborne concentration that equals the Annual Limit on Intake divided by the volume of air breathed by an average worker for a 
working year of 
2000 hours (assuming a breathing volume of 2400 m

Notes 
d.  Minimization of Contamination 
Areas   Loose contamination on work surfaces can result in contamination of shoes, clothing, and skin and thereby result in the potential for tracking of contamination into uncontrolled areas. 
 
This potential can be reduced by: 
 
•  minimizing the size and 
number of contamination areas, 
•  using disposable work 
surfaces (such as covering a bench top with plastic) when performing work that is likely to generate contamination, and 
•  promptly decontaminating 
work surfaces (good 
housekeeping). 
 
e.  Control of Movement of 
Equipment and Personnel 
 
The risk of spreading contamination to an uncontrolled area is directly related to the amount of equipment moved and the number of personnel exiting the contamination area. The risk of spreading contamination can be reduced by minimizing the movement of equipment and tools into and out of contaminated areas by using dedicated tools and equipment, and by performing as many work activities as practical outside contaminated areas. 
 result in a 
committed effective dose of 5 rems or a committed equivalent dose of 50 rems to any individual organ or tissue.

 48 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
Besides reducing the spread of contamination, these practices save money by: 
 
•  reducing the number of 
personnel requiring training, 
•  reducing the cost of 
decontaminating and surveying tools and equipment, 
•  reducing the cost of 
protective clothing used, and 
•  minimizing the production 
of radioactive waste. 
 
f.  Protective Equipment 
 
i.  Protective Clothing  
 
Use of protective clothing (PC) in contaminated areas will minimize the potential for skin contamination and 
ingestion of uranium. The 
choice of PC garments will be based on the type of job and the form of contamination hazards. Protective clothing should not be worn in uncontrolled areas such as lunch rooms.  
  
             Show OT-36  Discuss your facility specific protective clothing requirements.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 49 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 
Protective clothing commonly worn in the nuclear industry can also provide beta dose reduction. Gloves are especially helpful in reducing beta dose to the hands while handling uranium. Contamination build-up inside work gloves has lead to unacceptable hand doses in some facilities. Reuse of leather or cloth gloves should be reviewed carefully because of such buildup. Workers should wear thin, protective gloves inside the heavy gloves.  
 
ii.  Respiratory Protection 
 
Respiratory protection 
equipment is used to provide 
protection from airborne hazards that may be encountered in the work environment. Respirator use is based on the level of airborne contamination known to exist or expected to be produced from the work to be performed.  
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 50 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 
Respiratory protection may also be required for hazards present in an area other than radioactive airborne contamination. Health and safety groups should coordinate the use of respiratory protection requirements based on all hazards present. If a worker finds a conflict in respiratory protection requirements, he or she should not enter the work area until the conflict is resolved and the appropriate respiratory protection equipment is available. 
 
g.  Special Radiological Surveys 
and Techniques for Contamination Monitoring 
 
i.  Alpha Monitoring 
 
As workers at a uranium facility, you will likely perform self-monitoring for the presence of radioactive contamination.  If you recall from the general characteristics of uranium, it primarily decays by emitting an alpha particle. Many uranium decay products also decay by emitting alpha particles.    
  
             Highlight the personal contamination limits and monitoring techniques in use at your facility. Refer the students to and discuss the guidance specified in the RCS 
Appendix 3D. 
 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 51 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 Alpha particles are highly charged and will only travel about 2 inches in air. Alpha particles are al so stopped by 
the dead layer of skin. This means that alpha particles external to the body are not a health concern. It also means that alpha particles are hard to detect because the detector must be close to the source of the material emitting the alpha particle.  There are many detector types available for detecting alpha contamination. Two of the most commonly used types are scintillation detectors and gas proportional counters. A thin window Geiger-Mueller 
(GM) detector, such as a 
pancake probe, will also detect a small portion of the alpha radiation emitted. 
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 52 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
ii.  Beta-Gamma Monitoring  
Proportional counters and GM detectors are well suited for detecting beta-gamma radiation emitted by radioactive decay products in the uranium chain. Beta-gamma radiation travels further than alpha radiation and is easier to detect. For natural, depleted, and lower levels of enriched uranium, the ability to measure uranium by detecting the beta-gamma radiation from the uranium and its radioactive decay products is about five times more sensitive than by alpha monitoring alone. 
 
Many surfaces that could be 
contaminated are porous. If 
the uranium contamination is in the pores of the material or the surface of the material is wet, the alpha radiation will be blocked. Under these circumstances, beta-gamma monitoring is the only means of detecting the contamination. 
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 53 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
iii.  Monitoring Techniques 
 
When performing personnel monitoring it is very important to keep the detector (i.e., the probe) close to the surface being monitored and to move the detector slowly. If the detector is not held close to the surface being monitored, the alpha particles may not reach the detector. If the detector is moved too quickly across the surface, the electronics in the instrument will not have time to respond to indicate the amount of radioactive contamination present.  The general method for personnel scanning for alpha 
contamination is to scan at 
approximately 2 inches/sec at a distance of approximately ¼ inch. For personnel scanning for beta contamination, it is recommended to scan at 2 inches/sec at a distance of ½ inch. However, the surface being surveyed (i.e., soil, building surfaces, equipment, personnel), the scanning speed, and the instrument response time will determine the level of contamination that can be detected.  
  
             Discuss surface monitoring techniques based on the audience makeup. For example, general employees or radiation workers may only be concerned with 
personnel surveys, 
while radiological control technicians may be concerned with equipment and building surface surveys as well as personnel surveys.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 54 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 Failing to survey properly can have the same results as not surveying at all. Contamination may go undetected and may be tracked out of the radiological area. Once outside the radiological area, the contamination may be transferred from surface to surface. This transfer of contamination could result in uranium ending up inside your body, the body of a coworker, or even the bodies of your family members and friends. The potential for spreading undetected contamination should always be kept in mind when performing self-monitoring. 
 
iv.  Interference from Radon 
 
One of the problems encountered when monitoring for contamination is interference from radon and its decay products.  
  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 55 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
Radon is a radioactive gas that occurs naturally in the environment. It decays by alpha emission in the first of a series of very short half-life radionuclides that decay by alpha or beta-gamma emission.  There is a simple, inexpensive alternative to determine if the contamination is due to radon. The effective half-life for radon radioactive decay products is about 30 minutes, compared with the millions of years it takes for uranium to decay. The simple way to determine if contamination is due to radon is to wait and see if it goes away. The sample is 
recounted after the radon has 
an opportunity to decay to lower levels. The count rates are compared, and if the count rates are significantly different, radon is the most likely reason for the higher initial count rate.  
h.  Special Radiological Surveys 
and Techniques for Release of Materials with the Potential for Uranium Contamination  
  
                    Highlight the radioactive 
contamination limits 
used for release of materials and equipment at your facility.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 56 Module 104 Internal Dose Control  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
The alpha contamination detection problems mentioned in monitoring personnel for contamination also apply to monitoring material. An added problem is that uranium contamination may be located in areas not accessible to survey.  DOE requires that materials used in Contamination Areas, High Contamination Areas, and Airborne Radioactivity Areas that are being released for unrestricted use have accessible surfaces surveyed. Materials with inaccessible surfaces having a potential for internal contamination shall not be released without evaluating the material on a case-by-case basis to ensure internal contamination does not exist. 
 
DOE values for release of uranium contaminated materials are higher than DOE values for release of materials contaminated with some other radioactive nuclides found in the DOE system, such as plutonium. The difference in these values is due to the relative health risk from exposure to uranium contamination compared with these other nuclides.   
Release of materials with the potential for uranium contamination shall only be performed by personnel who are trained and authorized to do so. The site radiological c ontrol organization is 
responsible for designating and training these individuals. Also discuss the 
facility specific methods for surveying such equipment. Refer to DOE Order 5400.5 (as applicable).                 
 
    Emphasize that this training alone does not qualify individuals to survey and release materials.

Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 
i.  Bioassay Monitoring 
 
Bioassay monitoring, or measuring the amount of radio activity inside the 
body, can also be a way of determining if there has been a loss of control of uranium contamination. For example, if a person who works in an area with a relatively low airborne radioactivity concentration and shows an intake consistent with a higher airborne radioactivity concentration, there may have been a previously undetected loss of airborne contamination control. Routine bioassay monitoring will assist in making these determinations.

Lesson Plan Instructor’s Notes 
V.  MODULE 105 - Criticality Safety  
 
A.  Objectives  
EO8  Describe the criticality safety 
control measures for uranium, including inventory control measures. 
EO9  Identify criticality monitoring 
techniques used with uranium. 
  B.  Explanation of Criticality   
Uranium is a fissionable material, which means that it can undergo nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is a process in which a very heavy unstable atom primarily splits in two, or "fissions”. When an atom fissions, one large atom primarily becomes two smaller atoms, between one and seven neutrons are given off, and a great deal of energy in  radiation and other 
forms, such as the kinetic energy of the fission fragments, is released.  
Some unstable atoms, such as 235U, 
undergo a small amount of fission without any outside influences. This small amount of spontaneous fission does not present a significant hazard on its own, but the neutrons from this fission may be absorbed by other fissionable atoms. When an atom of fissionable material absorbs a neutron, the already unstable atom gains additional energy and becomes even more unstable. One way the unstable atom can get rid of its excess energy is through fission. 
 Show OT-37 
   NOTE: The training material in this module is not a substitute for criticality safety training.   Show OT-38  Energy given off during fission is approximately 200 MeV.   
  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 59 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
When neutrons from one fission cause fission in another atom, it is ca lled a chain reaction. If 
the chain reaction is self -sustaining, we call this 
criticality. Criticality is a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. This is an obvious radiation hazard because of the amount of energy given off as gamma radiation and other forms. 
 C.  Factors Affecting Criticality  
Criticality depends on several factors, including the enrichment of the material, the shape of the material, and surrounding materials, that may help or hinder fission. Several factors which affect the occurrence and magnitude of a criticality: 
 
1.  Quantity of Fissile Material 
 
When dealing with criticality, a common question is “How much material can I work 
with and still be safe?” There is some 
amount of the fissile material needed to 
have a criticality. This amount is called the “critical mass.” 
 
2.  Geometry 
 
To avoid a criticality event, the fissile material must not be placed in a shape, or geometry, that is favorable to criticality. In general, the lower the surface-to-volume 
ratio is, the greater the opportunity for 
criticality. 
 
  
                      
For example: a 
solid sphere, such as a billiard ball, has a much lower surface-to-volume ratio than a thin rectangular shape, such as a piece of paper.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 60 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
3.  Reflectors 
 
Sometimes, neutrons that are emitted from the fissile material may run into or otherwise interact with  an atom outside the 
fissile material and be "bounced back" or "reflected" into the fissile material. Materials such as water,  graphite (a form of 
carbon), and beryllium are good at reflecting neutrons. If the uranium material 
is surrounded by these reflector materials, criticality is easier to  obtain. Accordingly, it 
is undesirable to store fissile material where there is potential for these materials to be present. 
 
4.  Moderators 
 
Another factor that affect s criticality is the speed 
of the neutrons from fission. Neutrons that are traveling at about the same speed as the atoms in surrounding materials are more easily absorbed by fissile materials. Materials that slow the 
neutrons are known as moderators. Examples of 
good moderators include water and graphite. 
 
For an example of moderation, consider 235U. 
This uranium isotope absorbs slow neutrons (also called “thermal” ne utrons; these neutrons 
travel at the same speed as their surroundings) with a rather high proba bility for absorption. 
However, 238U only absorbs fast neutrons 
(those neutrons with high energies that travel faster than their surroundings). Normally fast neutrons are quickly moderated to lower 
energies, so that 238U will not go critical under 
normal conditions. The fast  neutrons must be 
moderated, or slowed, to allow 235U to go 
critical.   
   
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 61 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
 
5.  Neutron Absorbers (Poisons) 
 
If neutron absorbers ar e present (i.e., atoms 
and molecules with relatively high neutron absorption coefficients), these materials will remove neutrons from being available to begin or sustain cr iticality. Boron is an 
example of a frequently used neutron absorber, or “poison”. 
 
6.  Concentration or Density of Fissile 
Material 
 
As the concentration or density of fissile material increases, the opportunity for 
criticality increases because of an increased likelihood of neutron interaction with the fissile material. 
 
7.  Enrichment 
 
Enrichment is the separation of isotopes. 
With uranium, enrichment is typically 
referred to as increasing the percentage (by 
weight) of the 235U isotope in material to 
greater than that found in natural uranium. 
   
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008   
 62 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
Obviously, the enrichment of uranium plays an important role in criticality because the amount of fissile material available for criticality is greater. For example, the 
higher the enrichment of 235U (i.e., the 
concentration of 235U in relation to other 
uranium isotopes), the greater the opportunity for criticality. 
 
8.  Volume 
 
The volume of material in which fissile material is in solution can also play an important role in preventing criticality. For a given concentration or density of fissile material, the amount of fissile material will increase as the volume increases.  
 
9.  Interaction 
 
Neutron interaction in an array of 
containers of fissile material depends on geometric factors, including size, shape, 
and separation of the containers, as well as 
the size and shape of the array itself. Materials that may surround or be intermingled with the containers are also important. A close-packed array may become critical if flooded with water, which will thermalize neutrons. Also, a less closely-packed array may become critical if the water is removed, allowing less neutron absorption to take place.

 63 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
D.  Safety Policies and Controls  
Achieving criticality involves bringing together many factors that promote a sustained nuclear chain reaction. To avoid criticality, one should be aware of the conditio ns that would promote 
a criticality for the particular materials they encounter, and avoid those conditions that promote criticality. 
 
1.  General Criticality Safety Principles 
 
Some things done to promote criticality safety include: 
 
•  analyzing work environments to assess 
the risk of criticality and eliminate likely criticality concerns; 
•  using carefully planned and approved 
procedures; 
•  providing specific training for those 
personnel working in areas where fissile materials are present; and 
•  implementing system design features 
that are favorable to criticality safety. These features include: -  using containers with a size and 
geometry that will not allow criticality, 
-  designing piping systems to prevent 
buildup of uranium and prevent criticality, 
-  using materials known as poisons to 
absorb neutrons and prevent them from being absorbed by the uranium atoms, 
-  controlling material that surrounds 
containers or systems containing uranium, and 
-  controlling uranium inventories.

 64 Module 105 Criticality Safety  
Lesson Plan Instructor’s 
Notes 
2.  Controlling Uranium Inventories 
 
One method to prevent a criticality is controlling uranium inventories. Inventory control involves knowing where the uranium is at the facility and the level of enrichment of the uranium. Uranium 
enriched in 235U or the presence of 233U 
is of concern for critic ality; therefore, these 
are materials of concern for inventory 
control. Criticality is a concern for 238U if 
fast neutrons are present. 
 
Loss of control of fissile material presents a threat to criticality safety at the facility and, in a worst case scenario, to national security. It is no secret that groups throughout the world are striving to become nuclear powers. Even the appearance of a loss of inventory control must be avoided to keep the public trust and assure continued 
operations of DOE programs. For these reasons, inventories of fissile material are 
closely monitored.

1 I.  MODULE 101 - Properties of Uranium 
 
A.  Objective  
EO1 Describe the physical, radioactive, to xicological, and chemical properties and 
biological effects of uranium. 
 B.  Physical Properties  
Uranium can be encountered as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on its chemical form and 
surrounding conditions. Each of these physical forms has particular hazards. Sometimes, 
changing the form of uranium can lead to radioactive decay products accumulating or becoming concentrated in a particular location, such as on the surface of a liquid. The result 
can be an apparent increa se in the radioactivity. 
 
1.  Solid 
 
The solid forms of uranium are generally th e most stable configurations. The shiny, 
silvery metal form is rarely seen except in a workshop when it is being machined. After machining, the surface oxidizes, typically within hours, to a hard, black surface. 
 After some time, depending on temperature, humidity, and alloy, the surface may change color and begin to flake. Orange or  yellow colored surfaces are usually more 
flaky and soluble. In these forms, contamin ation can be more easily spread, inhaled, 
and absorbed into the body.

Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
2 2.  Liquid 
 
Uranium melts at 1133° °C, so molten uranium is unusual, except in a foundry. It has 
often been observed that the radioactivity appears to increase when uranium is melted. 
This is because radioactive decay products, such as radium and thorium, float to the 
surface. The density of radium is 5 g/cm 3, compared with 19 g/cm 3 for uranium; 
therefore, radium floats in molten uranium. Uranium in contact or solution with water is common. The primary hazards associated 
with a uranium solution are criticality (f or enriched uranium) and spills. Water 
decreases the quantity of enriched uranium re quired for criticality. This topic will be 
discussed in Module 105 - Criticality Safety. 
 
3.  Airborne Powder 
 
A spill of any radioactive solution is a concern. As the solution evaporates, it leaves 
behind a radioactive residue, or powder, th at can easily become airborne. Airborne 
uranium may be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs. 
 
4.  Gas 
 
Another form of uranium that is an  inhalation hazard is the volatile UF
6, becoming a 
gas above 56 °C. However, most uranium daughters are not volatile, and so can 
accumulate in storage cylinders. When the volatile UF6 is extracted, the nonvolatile 
daughters remain in the cyli nder, resulting in the buildup of residual radioactivity. 
However, in the case of uranium-232 ( 232U), uranium-235 ( 235U), and uranium-238 
(238U), each of these uranium isotopes has a radon daughter. Radon is a gas at all but 
very low temperatures; therefore, if the  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
3 radon escapes, the subsequent daughters can accumulate in closed or poorly ventilated 
areas. 
 In some situations, pressure from volatilized UF6 gas can build up in small volumes such as a sealed container or a pipe run be tween two valves. Line breaks and leaks will 
cause a release of the UF6. UF6 reacts in moist air to produce hydrogen fluoride (HF) 
gas. This gas is extremely corrosive and can severely damage the eyes, skin and lungs.  
Also, as the escaping UF6 gas cools, it becomes particulate, which may have a 
suffocating effect on any nearby workers.  
 
Another reason for pressure buildup is alpha  particles emitted in radioactive decay 
eventually becoming inert helium gas. The am ount is only significant for high specific 
activity forms of uranium. For example, a sample of 99% uranium-233 ( 233U) with 1% 
232U creates approximately its own volum e of helium gas every year. Sealed 
containers must include adequate gas space or  be fitted with pressure release valves. 
Once the pressure is relieved, the lo w-pressure helium gas is harmless. 
 
      Hydrogen gas is generated from uranium in water, and this may also produce a pressure 
buildup situation. Because the hydrogen buildup may also be a fire hazard, it is discussed later in this module in  the Chemical Properties section. 
 C.  Radioactive Properties  
Uranium in its pure metal form is a silvery, gray metal and is the heaviest naturally 
occurring element. There are 18 separate isot opes of uranium. Isotopes are elements that 
have the same number of protons, but di fferent numbers of neutrons. For example,  235U 
has 92 protons with 143 neutrons and  238U has 92 protons with 146 neutrons.  
 Uranium is radioactive. Partially because of its size, the nucleus of a uranium atom is 
unstable. It reduces its size either by alpha pa rticle emission or by nuclear fission, in which DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
4 the uranium nucleus splits, primarily, into two smaller fission produc ts. Both processes 
release energy, which can be helpful or harm ful depending on how th ey are controlled. 
 All isotopes of uranium are fissionable, which means they can be fissioned by fast 
neutrons. Two isotopes, 233U and  235U, are fissile, which means they can also be 
fissioned by slow (thermal) neut rons. A fissile material can be involved in a criticality 
accident, resulting in the release of a lethal am ount of radiation. Criticality is discussed in 
more detail in Module 105 – Criticality Safety.  The primary isotopes of uranium are all long- lived alpha emitters. However, several other 
radionuclides can be radiologically significan t at uranium facilities, depending on the 
history of the uranium materials and the pro cessing. These other radionuclides include the 
following beta emitters:  234Th, 234m Pa, 231Th, and  99Tc. The degree of enrichment also 
affects the controls that are required for extern al radiation exposure be cause of the increase 
in the amount of gamma-emitting  235U that is present. The uranium daughter products 
may also include some low-energy gamma and x-ray radiation. For example, the daughter 
products of  232U represent a potential gamma-emission hazard. 
 Although there are several isotopes of uranium, only three exist naturally, and all three are 
radioactive. See the table below for half-liv es and natural percent abundance for important 
uranium isotopes in the nuclear fuel cycle. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

As uranium goes through radioactive decay, it produces other radioactive elements 
known as radioactive decay products (also ca lled progeny or daughter  products). These 
radioactive decay products are also radioactive and have to  be taken into account for 
radiological protection purposes.  Both alpha and beta particles are emitted as part of decay series. For example, 
238U 
decays by alpha emission to 234Th; 234Th decays by beta emission to 234m Pa; and so 
on, until stable 206Pb is finally reached. ISOTOPE HALF-

Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
6 1.  Decay Series 
 
Uranium has two naturally occurring decay series: the “actinium” series, which has 
235U as its parent; and the “uranium” series, which has 238U as its parent. Many of our 
everyday encounters with radioactivity come  from these decay series; examples are 
radon gas and radium. There are also  man-made isotopes of uranium - 232U and 233U. 
The decay products from these radionuclides must be considered in the implementation of a radiological control progr am at a facility where these uranium nuclides are present. 
 
2.  Criticality 
 
Uranium is a fissionable material, which m eans it can undergo nuclear fission. Nuclear 
fission is a process in which a very heavy, unstable atom splits in two, or “fissions”. 
When an atom fissions, one large atom prim arily becomes two smaller atoms, between 
one and seven neutrons are given off (which  may cause fission in nearby atoms), and a 
great deal of energy is given off as radiation and in other forms, such as kinetic energy 
of the fission fragments. The radiation created could result in the creation of 
radiological areas, such as High or Very High Radiation Areas. Nuclear criticality 
associated with uranium will be discussed in greater detail later in the lesson. 
 D.  Chemical Properties  
Uranium is chemically reactive. It burns in air like magnesium; it is toxic like lead; and it 
forms a large variety of chemical compounds. A ll the isotopes of uranium have the same 
chemical reactivity, and all can be made in to the many different physical and chemical 
forms discussed in this section. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
7  
1.  Fire  
 
Uranium is a metal that will sustain a burni ng reaction (similar to a magnesium flare). 
The potential for a fire is greatest when the ur anium is in a finely divided form, such as 
milling chips or filings. In this form, uranium can undergo spontaneous ignition. Uranium metal is often machined to provide  a useful end product, and milling chips and 
filings are unavoidable byproducts.  Precautions must be taken to prevent chips and filings from igniting. One precaution is 
submersing the chips and filings in water or  a mineral oil. Stor age in water produces 
hydrogen gas due to a chemical reaction. To prevent the hydrogen ga s from reaching an 
explosive concentration, and to  prevent a pressure buildup, co ntainers must be vented. 
Incidents have occurred where container lids have been blown off by unexpected gas 
pressure buildup. The use of water or oil bath s for collecting and storing chips needs to 
be evaluated for criticality safety concerns before put into practice. 
 Once uranium starts to burn, it is extremely difficult to extinguish. None of the typical 
extinguishing methods, such as water, carbon di oxide, or halon, is effective in fighting 
uranium fires. In fact, halon may be explos ive and produce toxic fume s if used directly 
on the fire. Normally, small fires may be put  out by using MET-L-X powder, which is a 
mixture of sodium chloride (table salt ) and potassium carbonate (baking powder). 
When spread over the burning metal in signi ficant quantities, MET- L-X starves the fire 
of oxygen.   Larger fires, such as with storage drums,  are more difficult to extinguish. Submersion 
in water will eventually work once the metal cools down. However, continuous water 
addition is necessary to make up for lo sses due to boiling a nd evaporation.  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
8 2.  Toxicological/Biological Effects  
 
The principal entry of uranium into the human  system is due to either inhalation or 
ingestion. Inhalation occurs either from rel ease of volatile uranium compound or from 
suspension of volatile uranium-laden aerosols.  Ingestion can occur when the uranium is 
introduced into water for consumption or  the food chain by plant uptake. When 
uranium is either ingested or inhaled, it is removed from the body with a biological 
half-life varying between 6 and 5000 days , depending on which organ has become 
contaminated.  Uranium tends to concentrate in the kidneys  and the bones. Additionally, if inhaled, the 
lungs are exposed. Internal exposure to uran ium is controlled by limiting the ingestion 
and inhalation of this element. These met hods, along with measurement techniques, are 
discussed in Module 104. 
 
Most heavy metals, such as uranium, ar e toxic to humans depending on the amount 
introduced into the body. For short-term (acu te) exposures, the toxi cological effects are 
the primary concern, and acute exposures to  significant amounts of uranium may result 
in kidney damage. However, as the enrichment of the uranium in the 235U isotope 
increases, so too do the effects of radiation e xposure in relation to toxicological effects. 
 
Past industrial experience has proven that if there is a long-term exposure of small 
amounts of uranium (chronic exposure), th e radiological effects are the primary 
biological concern. In fact, for chronic expos ures, a development of  tolerance against 
the toxicological effects may occur. The prin cipal radiological hazard associated with 
uranium is due to the relatively high en ergy alpha particles its radionuclides and 
daughters emit. A chronic exposure to these radi onuclides results in an  increased risk of 
cancer, typically in the bones, kidney, a nd lungs, since these are the organs where 
uranium is deposited. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
9 3.  Chemical Reactivity 
 
The chemistry of uranium is complicated. Fo r example, uranium forms several oxides: 
UO, UO
2, UO 3, and UO 4. In general, a sample of uranium oxide will include a mixture 
of several of these. For example, U 3O8 is sometimes written as (UO 2)•2(UO 3).  
 
The lower oxidation states, UO 2 and U 3O8, tend to be dark brown or black. The higher 
oxidation states, UO 3 and UO 4, are generally orange or yellow, especially in solution or 
if water or crystallizat ion are present (e.g., (UO 4)• 2H 2O). Furthermore, the higher 
oxides usually flake off more easily and are us ually more soluble in water. Being flaky, 
they are more easily inhaled. Being more sol uble, they are more easily absorbed into 
the body.  Uranyl compounds, such as uranyl nitrate, or UO
2(NO 3)2, are chemical forms of 
uranium that are often found in  solution with water. They are generally yellow in color 
and are used in criti cality experiments. 
 Uranium reacts readily with air and water. For example, when uranium is machined, 
small chips catch fire from the heat of the machining process. Shavings placed in water 
react to produce hydrogen gas. The surfaces qui ckly oxidize to a hard black coating that 
is at first protective; however, under a dverse conditions, it corrodes and flakes. 
 Uranium also reacts with hydrogen or tr itium gas to form uranium hydride (UH
3). 
Uranium “beds” are commonly used to st ore tritium. Uranium hexafluoride (UF 6) 
reacts in moist air to produ ce hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, which is extremely corrosive 
and can severely damage the lungs if br eathed. Inhalation of HF has resulted in 
fatalities following UF 6 releases. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 101 – Properties of Uranium  
10 The chemical form of uranium is dependent on its intended use and its stage of 
production. For example, UF
6 is used during the enrichment process, and UO 2 is used 
as nuclear fuel. When handling uranium compounds, the possibility of chemical 
reactions must not be overlooked.DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

 B.  Importance of Uranium  
Uranium is a naturally occurring element used  primarily for producing energy with nuclear 
reactors and developing nuclear  weapons. It is also used for armor plating (depleted 
uranium), radiation shielding, and counterweights.  Historically, uranium was used for hundreds of years to color glass and as a glaze for tile 
and pottery. Bright orange “Fie sta-ware” dinner plates were prized for their color without 
any awareness of their radio activity. These plates are no longer produced, but are now 
collectors’ items among those in the nuclear i ndustry and others. Typically, the dose rate is 
about 5 mrem/hr (0.05 mSv/hr) on contact with these plates.  The original discovery of radioactivity involved uranium. In 1896, Henri Becquerel 
discovered that uranium would cause photograp hic film to become fogged because of 
radioactive emissions. Some of these emissions  were even more penetrating that the “X 
rays” that Wilhelm Roentgen had discovered a ye ar earlier. Later inve stigators, such as 
Marie Curie, isolated other radioactive elem ents from uranium ores. These elements are 
produced from the radioactive decay of uranium. The radioactive emission of an alpha particle causes uranium to change into t horium. Thorium goes on to decay to other 
elements, and so on, until a stable element such as lead is reached. 
 Radium and radon are the two most well-known radioactive decay products of uranium. 
Radium was once used for luminous instrument  dials and other produc ts. Radon is a heavy DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
12 radioactive gas that can accumulate in buildin gs and mines. Typically, these radioactive 
decay products are more hazardous than the uranium itself.  The importance of uranium increased dramatical ly with the discovery of nuclear fission in 
1938, the production of plutonium in 1940, and the construction of the first reactor in 1942 
under the direction of Enrico Fermi. These acco mplishments led to the Manhattan Project, 
in which uranium was enriched at Oak Ridge  or converted into plutonium at Hanford. 
These products were used to assemble the first atomic bombs at Los Alamos in 1945. 
 After the end of World Wa r II in 1945, the importance of uranium remained high. 
Production of uranium and plutonium for “at omic” or “nuclear” weapons continued 
throughout the Cold War. In addition, nucle ar reactors were built for the propulsion of 
naval submarines and ships, and for the commer cial production of elect ricity. Now, most of 
the world’s production of uranium is used for nuclear reactors. 
 
C.  Sources of Uranium 
 
Uranium is found in the earth's crust and is mi ned as ore. The average concentration is 2 
parts per million (ppm) in the crust and less than 2 parts per billion (ppb) in the oceans. During the 1960's and 1970's, a program titled the Natural Uranium Resource Exploration 
was funded by the government to identify the lo cations of desirable uranium ore throughout 
the United States. It was determined that the most desirable locations of uranium are in the Colorado Plateau, the Wyoming Basin, and the fl anks of the Black Hills in South Dakota. 
In those locations, the uranium concentration is much higher than 2 ppm. Uranium is also 
found on the African Continent. The ore is removed from eith er shallow open pits (less 
than 300-foot, or 100m, depths) or underground mines (greater than 300-foot depths). The 
typical uranium content of the ore is 0.15 - 0.3 percent a nd is in the form of U
3O8, which is 
called "yellowcake.” Uranium is also found in secondary minerals in the following forms: 
complex oxides, silicates, phosphates, and vanadates. 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
13 D.  Uranium Operations and Processes 
 
Uranium processing is dependent upon the de sired product, but it generally involves the 
following cycle:  
•   mining and milling, 
•   conversion, 
•   enrichment, 
•  fabrication, 
•  use, 
•  waste disposal/storage, and 
•  decontamination and decommissioning. 
 
1.  Uranium Mining and Milling 
 
After removal from the mine, the uranium ore is milled to extract the yellowcake. This involves the following process: 
 
a.  The ore is crushed, ground, and mixe d with water to prepare for chemical 
processing. 
 b.  The crushed ore and water mixture is mixed with chemicals to separate the 
yellowcake from the ore. This separa tion process is calle d "leaching.” The 
resultant products include a slurry of yellowcake ready for additional processing and a mixture of low-grade crushed ro ck and sand called "mill tailings.”  
 
Only about 3 percent of the actual materi al removed from the mine ends up as 
yellowcake, which means that millions of tons of mill tailings are leftover. Yellowcake contains 70-90% by weight of uranium oxides. The leftover mill DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
14 tailings are a concern because they still contain some of the uranium ore. 
Additional hazards exist due  to the chemicals added. 
 It is estimated that the uranium milling in the United States left approximately 
138 million tons of mill tailings covering about 3,000 acres of land. 
 
c.  The yellowcake slurry is then purif ied by either ion exchange or solvent 
extraction. 
 
d.  Following purification, the yellowcake sl urry is dried, forming a concentrated 
yellowcake compound that contains 75 - 98 percent uranium. The yellow color is 
caused by the addition of leaching chemicals and their eventual removal during the drying step. The final color can range from yellow to orange to black depending on the chemicals used and the drying temperature. 
 
The final color is a good indicator of solubi lity, and thus of bi ological effects if 
uranium in this form is taken into th e body. Less soluble uranium compounds tend 
both to remain in the body longer and to be  darker in color. More soluble uranium 
compounds are removed from the body more quickly by normal body functions, and tend to be lighter in color. 
 
2.  Conversion 
 
At this stage in the nuclear fuel cycle,  the yellowcake is converted into uranium 
hexafluoride (UF
6) for enrichment. This is accomplished by: 
 
a.  Conversion of yellowcake to pure uranium trioxide (UO 3), called "orange oxide" 
or "orange salt,” by solvent extraction and follow-up drying. 
 b.  Conversion of UO
3 to uranium dioxide UO 2. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
15  
c.  Conversion of UO
2 to uranium tetrafluoride (UF 4) by hydrofluorination (addition 
of hydrogen fluoride gas). This pr oduct is called "green salt.” 
 d.  Reacting the UF
4 with fluorine gas (F 2) to form uranium hexafluoride (UF 6), 
which is a volatile form ready for enrichment. The UF 6 is a solid at room 
temperature but readily becomes a gas when heated above 56°C. 
 
3.  Enrichment 
 
The enrichment process is necessary to increase the percentage of the 235U isotope in 
the uranium to make it suitable for reactor fuel. Natural uranium contains 0.7% 235U. 
Typically, enriched uranium contains 2-4% 235U. Other uses may require much higher 
concentrations up to, or even greater than, 90% 235U. Depleted uranium, which is left 
over after the enrichme nt process, has an abundance of about 0.2% 235U.  
 
The methods used to en rich uranium include: 
 
a.  Gaseous Diffusion 
 
Gaseous diffusion is based on principles of gas laws. The UF 6 gas is forced 
through converters by large compressors. The converters contain many tubes 
made of a special barrier ma terial that is porous. The 235UF 6 molecules are 
lighter than the 238UF 6 molecules and bounce against the porous barrier more 
frequently. The 235UF 6 has a greater chance of passing through the barrier, 
resulting in a slightly richer 235U content. It may take as many as a thousand 
passes to obtain the desired degree of enrichment.  
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
16 b.  Laser Processes 
 
The Atomic Vaporization Laser Is otope Separation (AVLIS) involves 
vaporization, selective ioni zation of one isotope, a nd subsequent electrical 
separation. Currently, no DOE production plants exist which use this technology. 
 
c.  Nozzle Separation 
 
The nozzle separation process is based on the different speeds of 235U and 238U 
compounds when they are injected th rough a nozzle into a small chamber. 
 d.  Centrifugal Separation 
 
Centrifugal separation is based on heavier compounds migrating to the outside 
when spun at a high rate of speed. 
 
The uranium left over from the enrichment process is mostly  238U, with a reduced 
amount of  235U (usually 0.2% by weight). This  byproduct is called "depleted 
uranium" and has additional uses such as  radiation shieldi ng, armor plating, and 
ammunition.  
 
During World War II, uranium work was secret and code names were used for the different forms of uranium. Natural uraniu m was named “Tuballoy,” a name that grew 
out of a cover story that the Allies were investigating alloys for high-quality tubing. 
Highly enriched uranium was then named “Oralloy” for “Oak Ridge Alloy,” sometimes abbreviated to “Oy.” Depleted uraniu m was once called depletalloy, but more 
commonly was called “D-38” si nce it consists mostly of  238U. These historical names 
are sometimes still used within the DOE complex. 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
17 4.  Fabrication 
 
The last step in the nuclear fuel cycle is changing the enriched uranium into an 
appropriate form for fabric ation. The fabrication proce ss differs depending on the 
application. For fabrication of fuel elem ents, the process generally includes the 
following steps. 
 
a.  Uranium dioxide (UO
2) is produced by reacting UF 6 with water and then with a 
hydroxide salt. 
 b.  The resulting precipitate is dried to form "orange oxide," which is reduced with 
hydrogen to form UO
2 powder. 
 c.  The UO
2 powder is compacted into cylindrical pellets that are loaded into 
thinwalled tubes made of either stainle ss steel or an alloy of zirconium called 
"zircalloy.” 
 d.  Helium, an inert gas, is pumped into the tubes, which are then capped. A cluster 
of these tubes separated by spacers forms a reactor fuel assembly.  
 
Fabrication of other materials, such as wea pons parts, may also include materials made 
with uranium. 
 5.  Uses  
The primary goal of the uranium fuel cycle pr ocess is to yield enriched uranium. This 
product can be used for: 
 
• power reactors, 
• research reactors, DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
18 • nuclear weapons, and 
• naval propulsion reactors. 
 
There are also a number of uses fo r uranium metal depleted in the 
235U isotope, such as: 
 
• radiation shielding, 
• armor-piercing bullets, 
• catalysts for chemical reactions, 
• armor plating, and 
• counter weights. 
 
Depleted uranium typically is cast into ingot s or billets, and then shipped to production 
facilities for appropriate reshaping. 
 6.  Reprocessing  
Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is no longe r performed in this country. This information 
is provided for the purpose of describing how th e process worked at ap plicable facilities. 
 
Uranium was used in plutonium production reacto rs. Uranium fuel and targets were coated 
with aluminum or zirconium metal and placed in  the reactor. As they were irradiated with 
neutrons, a small fraction of the ur anium was converted to plutonium. 
 
The irradiated fuel was then removed from the reactor, but the plutonium and uranium had 
to be separated from the fission products cr eated during irradiation. PUREX, a chemical 
process for plutonium and uranium extraction from irradiated nuc lear fuel, was developed 
to accomplish this separation. This repr ocessing was accomplished as follows: 
 
a.  Excess metal was mechanically removed to expose the fuel material.  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
19 b.  The fuel was leached with aci d to remove it from the cladding. 
 c.  The uranium and other elements were  separated by solvent extraction (chemical 
separation). 
 d.  The uranium was converted back to UF
6 for enrichment. 
 7.  Waste Disposal and Storage  
Due to the remaining radioactive properties, the nuclear fuel cycle byproducts must be 
controlled and/or disposed. These byproducts  can be divided into two categories—low 
level waste (LLW) and high-level waste (HLW). 
 
a.  LLW 
 
The RCS glossary defines low-level waste (LLW) as “Waste that contains radioactivity 
and is not classified as hi gh-level waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or 
byproduct material as defined in Section 11e(2 ) of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended. 
Test specimens of fissionable material irradi ated only for research and development and 
not for production of power or plutonium may be classified as lo w-level waste provided 
the concentration of transuranic activity  is less than 100 nCi/g.”  LLW could be in the 
form of liquids, solids, or gasses. Liquid  waste is usually processed to remove 
radioactive material and th en recycled or disposed. 
 Solids may be volume-reduced by incineration or compaction. Soluble forms in liquid may be solidified to isolate radioactive contents.  Gases are either changed to a solid form a nd disposed of as a solid or compressed and 
stored as gases. These gases may be released after sufficient time has elapsed for decay of the radioactive co mponent of the gas. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
20 b.  HLW 
 
High-level waste (HLW) is defined in DOE M 435.1-1 as “The highly radioactive 
waste material resulting from the reproce ssing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid 
waste produced directly in re processing and any solid material derived from such liquid 
waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations; and other highly 
radioactive material that is  determined, consistent with  existing law, to require 
permanent isolation”.  HLW comes primarily from the re processing of spent fuel. It is typically in liquid form, 
and it is collected and stored in tanks. The liquid waste is then solidified (stabilized) for 
disposal. All HLW is ultimately to be disposed of by deep burial. 
 8.  Decontamination and Decommissioning of Uranium Facilities  
Uranium and its byproducts from the nuclear fu el cycle may present health risks due to 
radioactivity or chemical properties. Past and present DOE uranium facilities and their 
surrounding areas may contain contamination from uranium or its byproducts. DOE 
recognizes that they have a responsibility to re store these potentially co ntaminated facilities 
and surrounding areas to a non-hazardous condition. To accomplish this, several 
“remediation” programs are in place and others are developing.  One cleanup program is: 
 
Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Program This program is intended to cleanup uranium mill sites and associated “vicinity properties.” It 
covers 24 mill sites and more than 4,800 properties throughout the Nation. The goals of the program are to reduce radon re lease from mill taili ngs to acceptable 
levels by burial, and to restore affected land and facilities/structures to 
unrestricted use. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 102 – The Nuclear Fuel Cycle  
21  
Each cleanup project presents different t ypes and levels of hazards to workers. 
Additionally, general safety h azards become a significant fa ctor due to the types of 
processes and equipment used to remove th e uranium-contaminated materials. Usually 
these projects require some level of structural decontam ination and soil remediation. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

Module 103 – External Dose Control  
23 III.  MODULE 103 - External Dose Control 
 
A.  Objectives  
EO4 Identify the radiological concerns  of external exposure to uranium. 
EO5 Describe the measures taken to c ontrol external exposure to uranium. 
 
B.  Alpha External Dose  
Because of the relatively short range of alpha  particles in dense matter, alpha radiation 
poses little external dose hazard. The mo st energetic alphas produced by naturally 
occurring radionuclides will ba rely penetrate the dead layer of skin on the human body. 
Little living tissue will be affected when the alpha source is external to the skin. 
 C.  Beta External Dose 
 
Beta doses to the skin, extremities, and the le ns of the eye can be limiting in facilities 
which process unshielded depleted, natural, or  low-enrichment uranium. Processes which 
separate and sometimes concentrate beta-e mitting uranium daughters are not uncommon in 
DOE uranium facilities. Control of exposure is complicated by the fact that considerable 
contact work takes place in faciliti es which process uranium metal.  
 Several uranium radioactive decay products ar e beta emitters. Normally, most of these 
betas are shielded by the surrounding material  or material worn as personal protective 
clothing (such as Tyvek). A primary radionuclid e of concern is protactinium-234 in its 
metastable state ( 234m Pa), a daughter of  238U which produces a very high energy beta 
particle that can travel up to 20 feet in air.  Significant beta radiation is also emitted from  
234Th (also a daughter of  238U) and  231Th (a daughter of  235U). Typically, these are 
shielded with ½-inch of plastic. 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 103 – External Dose Control  
24 D.  Gamma and X-Ray External Dose 
 
Although beta dose from unshielded uranium pres ents the most common radiation problem, 
storage of large quantities of uranium can create low-level gamma radiation fields (less 
than 5 mrem/hr). Such fields can create ex ternal exposure problems, particularly when 
significant numbers of people are working in adjacent areas.  
In addition to gamma emissions from the uranium decay chains ( 238U and 235U), recycled 
fuel materials introduced back into the enri chment process will result in higher gamma 
radiation fields because of 228Th, a gamma-emitting daughter of 232U with a relatively 
short half-life (1.9 yr).  Larger sources of gamma radiation may exist from specific uranium processes, including 
unflushed UF
6 cylinders. Gamma radiation emitted from residual materials can result in 
gamma radiation fields of several hundred  millirem per hour. This problem can be 
controlled by flushing empty cylinders  to remove residual material. 
 E.  Neutron External Dose  
As uranium is processed in the fuel cycle, it is often chemically bonded to fluorine to create 
compounds such as UF
4 and UF 6. When uranium atoms in these compounds decay, they 
emit alpha particles that are sometimes captu red by the neighboring fluorine atoms. The 
resulting atom is unstable and may emit a neutro n to gain back its stability. The neutrons 
emitted can result in neutron radiation fields between 4 and 8 mrem/h.  The probability of spontaneous fission is sm all; therefore exposure is not expected. 
However, if fission does occur, such as in a reactor or from experiments, the neutron 
radiation is typically contained. Neutron radiation that is not contained is usually the result 
of a criticality accident which generates potentially fatal doses of gamma radiation. 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 103 – External Dose Control  
25 F.  External Dose Measurements 
 
The radiation from uranium that affects ex ternal dose includes beta, gamma, X-ray and 
neutron irradiation. An effec tive external exposure control program for uranium requires a 
variety of radiation detection instruments that are responsive  to these forms of radiation. 
Radiation surveys should be performed on a routine basis and during events, tasks, 
procedures, or situations that are likely to cause radiologi cal conditions to change. There 
are two general categories of  measurement used for extern al exposure associated with 
uranium, portable survey instruments and personnel dosimeters.  Gamma radiation from uranium is normally not the controlling problem. For example, the contact beta radiation field from depleted uranium is approximately 240 millirem per hour, 
while the contact gamma radiation field is  less than 10 millirem per hour. However, 
significant gamma fields can exist in areas wh ere large quantities of uranium are stored, 
such as a storage area for uranium contaminated soil. The accuracy and precision of survey 
instruments used for measurement of beta radiation fields depend on many factors which 
must be addressed, such as energy response and geometry factors. Accordingly, these 
surveys are typically conducted by Radiologi cal Control personnel. Neutron fields from 
enriched uranium fluoride compounds can also add to this area of concern. Depending on 
the magnitude of neutron fields generated, pe riodic neutron dose rate measurements are 
made, typically by Radiological Control personnel.   Personnel dosimeters produce the data which be comes the formal or “legal” record of 
personnel exposure, thermoluminescent dosimeter s, used in most DOE uranium facilities, 
provides the most accurate and precise means of measuring doses received by workers. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 103 – External Dose Control  
26  
G.  External Dose Reduction and Control Techniques  
1.  External Dose Control Program 
 
The primary purpose of an external dose cont rol program is to control dose to the 
individual radiation worker to below regul atory limits and administrative levels and 
ensuring that doses are As Low As Reasonabl y Achievable (ALARA). In all cases at 
DOE facilities, dose re ceived by an individua l shall not exceed the limits specified in 
Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 835 (10 CFR 835). 
 The elements of an external dose control program include: 
 
• detecting and characterizing the beta, ga mma, X-ray, and neutron radiation fields; 
• measuring and/or quantifyi ng these radiation fields; 
• measuring personnel exposure; and 
• determining external expo sure control practices. 
 
2.  General External Dose Control Practices 
 
These general principles should be applied to control external dose from uranium: 
 
• minimizing time in the radiation field, 
• maximizing the distance from the radiation source, 
• using shielding to reduce the radiation field, and 
• reducing the amount of radioa ctive material being used. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 103 – External Dose Control  
27  
3.  Specific Beta Dose Control Principles  
Surfaces emitting beta radiation are easily shielded with pl astic or other light element 
materials. Use of denser materials for shield ing of high-energy beta  radiation may produce 
bremsstrahlung X-rays and should be avoided.  Beta dose to the lens of the eye can be reduced  by using safety glasses. Safety glasses are 
commonly worn for industrial safety concerns  in areas where uranium is handled. Heavy 
rubber or leather gloves are eff ective in reducing the skin dos e to the hand, but their use 
must be balanced against other safety concerns , such as hazards from machinery or loss of 
manual dexterity.  Industrial safety concerns in a uranium fac ility may be more hazardous to personnel than 
exposure to radiation. Professi onal radiological control perso nnel evaluate the process in 
the workplace to ensure workers receive the maximum overall protection from all hazards, 
not only radiological hazards. Th is is generally done in coope ration with industrial safety 
and industrial hygiene personnel.  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
28 IV. MODULE 104 - Internal Dose Control 
 
A.  Objectives  
EO6  Identify the modes of en try into the body for uranium. 
EO7  Describe the measures taken to control intakes of  uranium, including special 
radiological surveys and techniques, inst ruments, and release of materials. 
 
B.  Internal Exposure to Uranium  
As discussed in Module 101, the primary biologi cal hazard is the potential for uranium to 
be taken into the body. This exposure may re sult in heavy metal poisoning, including 
kidney damage (for acute exposures), or an in creased cancer risk (for chronic exposures). 
Uranium may enter the body th rough inhalation, ingestion, abso rption through the skin, or 
injection into the bloodstream, such as from  contamination of an open wound. The most 
common route of entry is inhala tion, but much of the material inhaled does not stay in the 
lungs. The lungs and related air passages cons tantly work to remove all the dust we 
breathe, including dust that cont ains uranium. The dust expell ed from the lungs but not 
exhaled is swallowed, so some of the inhale d uranium ends up in the digestive tract.  
 The amount of uranium retained in the lungs depends a great d eal on the size of the particle 
breathed. The smallest particles tend to be e xhaled or absorbed into the bloodstream, while 
the largest particles are usually  removed before they reach the lung. Uranium retained in 
the lungs may remain there or be absorbed into the bloodstream. Part of the uranium 
passing through the digestive trac t may also be absorbed in the bloodstream. Uranium in 
the bloodstream is either transferred to va rious organs or excreted via the urine. 
 
The enrichment of the uranium in its  235U isotope also plays a role in determining whether 
the radiological or the chem ical effects are the limiting factor. For acute exposures, 
chemical toxicity is lim iting up to 39% enrichment. Beyond 39%, the effective dose DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
29 becomes limiting. For chronic e xposures, chemical toxicity is more limiting up to 1.3% 
enrichment. Beyond 1.3%, the effective dose becomes limiting.  
C.  Internal Dose Measurements  
Once in the body, the presence of uranium can be  detected using indirect radioactivity 
measurements, direct radioact ivity measurements, or both. 
 At one time, it was not possible to detect in ternal uptakes of uran ium or certain other 
radioactive materials at levels below the poi nt at which the annual limit for exposure (5 
rem) was received. Any measurable intake of  uranium was therefore considered to be 
unacceptable. Improved analytical and calculati onal techniques have now made it possible 
to measure uranium concentrations resulti ng in exposures of a bout 10 mrem with a 
reasonable degree of accuracy. The estimation of low-level internal e xposure to uranium is 
no longer a matter for inordinate concern. 
 
1.  Indirect or In Vitro Measurement 
 
Bodily processes will, to some degree, eliminate uranium taken into the body. How 
effective the body is at eliminating the ur anium, and how long the process takes, 
depends upon individual metabolism and th e chemical form of the uranium. For 
example, uranium hexafluoride contains ur anium that is chemically bound to fluorine 
and is more easily eliminated than  uranium metal or uranium dioxide. 
 Indirect measurements are made by sampli ng material eliminated by the body for the 
presence of uranium. It is possible to anal yze both feces and urine for the presence of 
uranium, but due to the ease of collecti on and handling, the most common method used 
is urinalysis. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
30  
2.  Direct or In Vivo Measurement 
 
Direct measurements are performed using whole body counters or lung counters. These 
instruments detect gamma and X-rays emitted from radioactive material inside the 
body. For example, the 235U and uranium-234 (
234U) isotopes of uranium present in 
enriched uranium emit X-rays that can be detected. Alpha and beta radiation emitted by 
material inside the body is shielded by body tissue and cannot be detected. 
 Direct measurement is useful for detecting uranium that is not easily eliminated by the body. This method may also be used to estimate an internal dose. Because of the very low energy and intensity of gamma radiation emitted from depleted uranium, direct 
measurements are not effective in de tecting depleted uranium in the body. 
 D.  Internal Dose Reduction and Control Techniques 
 
The hierarchy for minimization of intern al dose is given in the RCS, Article 316. 
Engineering controls should be the primary method of minimizing airborne contamination 
and internal exposure to workers, where pr acticable. Administrativ e controls, including 
access controls and specific work practices, s hould be used as the secondary method to 
minimize internal exposure. If the potential fo r airborne radioactivity  still exists after 
engineering and administrative controls have b een applied, respiratory protection should be 
considered. Other specific cont rols, such as stay times, worker safety, comfort, and 
efficiency, are also discussed in Article 316.  The internal exposure resulting from uranium entering the body can be properly controlled 
by appropriate facility and equipment desi gn, contamination control procedures, and 
protective clothing. A bioassay monitoring progr am to determine the amount of uranium 
taken into the body is also an integral  part of internal exposure control. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
31  
1.  Contamination Control Philosophy  
The control of contamination in the work place is a significant part of the overall 
radiological protection program at uranium facilities. Proper contamination control will:  
• limit internal exposure by minimizing th e ingestion, inhalatio n, absorption, and 
injection of uranium; 
• limit external dose from uranium and its radioactive decay products; and 
• prevent the spread of radioactive materials into uncontrolled areas. 
 
2.  Contamination Control Methods 
 
Because uranium is relatively less hazardous than some other radioactive materials, 
such as plutonium, some people can develop an  overly relaxed attit ude to uranium; in 
effect saying, “It’s only uranium.” Care must be taken to avoid this attitude, and to 
control uranium contamination in complia nce with regulation s, policies, and 
procedures. Uranium contamination can  be effectively controlled by: 
  
• an evaluation of activitie s likely to generate or spread contamination,  
• use of containment devices to confine c ontamination as close to the source as 
possible, 
• control and monitoring of airborne contamination as it is generated, 
• minimizing the size and number of c ontaminated areas by using effective 
decontamination methods, 
• control of movement  of equipment and personnel in to and out of contaminated 
areas, 
• use of personal protective equipment, and DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
32 • effective contamin ation monitoring. 
 
a.  Evaluation of Work Activities 
 
Work activities that involve the destruction of surfaces, such as grinding, machining, filing, or cutting, can easily create and spread contamination. Operations such as welding, burning, hea ting, etc. can alter the physical and/or 
chemical state of uranium compounds th at are on the surfaces of equipment. 
Work activities such as these should be ev aluated and steps taken to minimize the 
spread of surface contamination, personnel contamination, and airborne contamination. If possible, alternative methods for comp leting the task should be 
considered. 
 b.  Use of Containment Devices 
 
Whenever activities that may genera te loose contamination are planned, 
consideration should be given to usi ng containment devices to control the 
contamination to an area as close to the source as possible. Such devices include 
glovebags, gloveboxes, and tents. 
  
c.  Control and Monitoring of Airborne Contamination 
 
Uranium contamination is relatively dens e (heavy) so it is not easily stirred up 
into the air and quickly sett les out when disturbed. Ther efore, it is unlikely that 
significant airborne contamination will result from normal activities (such as 
walking) in areas contaminated with uranium. It is possible for airborne 
contamination to result from activity that vigorously disturbs th e surface, such as 
sweeping, grinding, welding, and direct, high -volume air flow. Failure to control DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
33 airborne contamination could result in i nhalation of the contamination and spread 
of contamination to other areas.  Control of airborne contamination should include: 
 
• an evaluation of activities that are likely to cause contamination to become 
airborne, 
• engineered controls such as instal led or portable vent ilation with High 
Efficiency Particulate Air filtration systems (HEPA systems) to remove 
contamination from the air at a point as close to the source as possible,  
• physical barriers (e.g., pipes, gloveboxes, etc) and pressure differential zones, 
• use of alternate work activities or equi pment that is less likely to generate 
airborne contamination, 
• air sampling to track airborne  contamination levels, and 
• using respiratory protection to mini mize internal dose of the worker. 
 
Monitoring for airborne contamin ation can take several forms: 
 
• long-term, low-volume air samples that provide an average of the airborne 
concentration over a given time; 
• short-duration, high-volume air samples taken in the breathing zone of a 
worker during work activities likely to  generate airborne contamination; 
• low-volume (about 2 liters per minute) br eathing zone samples from personal 
air monitors; and [Note: A liter is approximately the same volume as a quart. 
Use the concept of a 2-liter soda bottle to descri be the quantity.] 
• continuous air monitors that track air borne contamination levels over time and 
can be set to alarm if a specified level is reached.  
 
It is important that air samples represen t the actual airborne contamination levels 
breathed by the worker so that accurate intakes may be estimated. Air monitoring DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
34 is also used to detect lo ss of containment. It is important to ensure sample 
volumes and methods allow detection of ai rborne contamination levels below the 
level of concern. 
 
d.  Minimization of Contamination Areas 
 
Loose contamination on work surfaces can result in contamination of shoes, clothing, and skin and thereby result in the potential for tracki ng of contamination 
into uncontrolled areas.  This potential can be reduced by: 
 
• minimizing the size and number of contamination areas, 
• using disposable work surfaces (such as covering a benchtop with plastic) 
when performing work that is likel y to generate contamination, and 
• promptly decontaminating work surfaces (good housekeeping). 
 
e.  Control of Movement of Equipment and Personnel 
 
The risk of spreading contamination to an uncontrolled area is directly related to 
the amount of equipment moved and the number of personnel exiting the contamination area.  The risk of spreading contamination can  be reduced by minimizing the movement 
of equipment and tools into and out of contaminated areas by using dedicated 
tools and equipment, and by performing as  many work activities as practical 
outside contaminated areas.  Besides reducing the spread of contamin ation, these practices save money by: 
 DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
35 • reducing the number of personnel requiring training, 
• reducing the cost of decontaminating and surveying tools and equipment, 
• reducing the cost of prot ective clothing used, and 
• minimizing the production of radioactive waste. 
 
f. Protective Equipment 
 
i.  Protective Clothing 
 
Use of protective clothing (PC) in contaminated areas will minimize the potential for skin contamination and i ngestion of uranium. The choice of PC 
garments will be based on the type of job and the form of contamination hazards. Protective clothing should not be worn in uncontrolled areas such as lunch rooms.  Protective clothing commonly worn in th e nuclear industry can also provide 
beta dose reduction. Gloves are especially  helpful in reducing beta dose to the 
hands while handling uranium.  Contamination build-up inside work gl oves has lead to unacceptable hand 
doses in some facilities. Reuse of leather or cloth gloves should be reviewed carefully because of such buildup. Wo rkers should wear thin, protective 
gloves inside the heavy gloves. 
 
ii.  Respiratory Protection 
 
Respiratory protection equipment is used to provide protection from airborne 
hazards that may be encountered in the work environment. Respirator use is 
based on the level of airborne contaminat ion known to exist or expected to be 
produced from the work to be performed. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
36  
Respiratory protection may also be requi red for hazards present in an area 
other than radioactive airborne cont amination. Health and safety groups 
should coordinate the use of respiratory protection requirements based on all 
hazards present. If a worker finds a conflict in respiratory protection requirements, he or she should not en ter the work area until the conflict is 
resolved and the appropriate respirator y protection equipment is available. 
 
g.  Special Radiological Surveys and Te chniques for Contamination Monitoring 
 
i.  Alpha Monitoring 
 
As workers at a uranium facility, you will likely perform self-monitoring for the presence of radioactive contamination.  
If you recall from the general characteris tics of uranium, it primarily decays 
by emitting an alpha particle. Many uran ium decay products also decay by 
emitting alpha particles.  Alpha particles are highly charged and w ill only travel about 2 inches in air. 
Alpha particles are also stopped by the d ead layer of skin. This means that 
alpha particles external to the body are not  a health concern. It also means that 
alpha particles are hard to detect beca use the detector must be close to the 
source of the material emitting the alpha particle.  There are many detector types availabl e for detecting alpha contamination. 
Two of the most commonly used types are scintillation detectors and gas 
proportional counters. A thin window Geig er-Mueller (GM) detector, such as 
a pancake probe, will also detect a small portion of the alpha radiation emitted. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
37  
ii.  Beta-Gamma Monitoring 
 
Proportional counters and GM detectors are well suited for detecting beta-
gamma radiation emitted by radioactive decay products in the uranium chain. 
Beta-gamma radiation travels further th an alpha radiation and is easier to 
detect. For natural, depleted, and lower le vels of enriched uranium, the ability 
to measure uranium by detecting the be ta-gamma radiation from the uranium 
and its radioactive decay products is a bout five times more sensitive than by 
alpha monitoring alone. 
 
Many surfaces that could be contaminated are porous. If the uranium contamination is in the pores of the mate rial or the surface of the material is 
wet, the alpha radiation will be bloc ked. Under these circumstances, beta-
gamma monitoring is the only means of detecting the contamination. 
 
iii.  Monitoring Techniques 
 When performing personnel monitoring it is very important to keep the 
detector (i.e., the probe) close to the surface being monitored and to move the 
detector slowly. If the detector is not held close to the surface being 
monitored, the alpha particles may not re ach the detector. If  the detector is 
moved too quickly across the surface, the electronics in the instrument will 
not have time to respond to indicate the amount of radioactive contamination 
present.  The general method for personnel scanning for alpha contamination is to scan 
at approximately 2 inches/sec at a distance of approximately ¼ inch. For personnel scanning for beta contaminati on, it is recommended to scan at 2 
inches/ sec at a distance of ½ inch. Ho wever, the surface being surveyed (i.e., DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
38 soil, building surfaces, equipment, personnel), the scanning speed, and the 
instrument response time will determine th e level of contamination that can be 
detected.  Failing to survey properly can have the sa me results as not surveying at all. 
Contamination may go undetected and may be tracked out of the radiological 
area. Once outside the radiological area, the contamination may be transferred 
from surface to surface. This  transfer of contaminati on could result in uranium 
ending up inside your body, the body of a co-worker, or even the bodies of 
your family members and friends. The potential for spreading undetected 
contamination should always be kept in mind when performing self-monitoring. 
 
iv.  Interference from Radon 
 
One of the problems encountered when monitoring for contamination is 
interference from radon and its decay products. 
 Radon is a radioactive gas that occurs na turally in the envi ronment. It decays 
by alpha emission in the first of a series  of very short ha lf-life radionuclides 
that decay by alpha or beta-gamma emission.  There is a simple, inexpensive alternative to determine if the contamination is due to radon. The effective half-life for radon radioactive decay products is 
about 30 minutes, compared with the millions of years it takes for uranium to decay. The simple way to determine if c ontamination is due to radon is to wait 
and see if it goes away. The sample is recounted after the radon has an 
opportunity to decay to lower levels. Th e count rates are compared, and if the 
count rates are significantly different, radon is the most likely reason for the 
higher initial count rate. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
39  
h.  Special Radiological Surveys and Techni ques for Release of Materials with the 
Potential for Uranium Contamination.  The alpha contamination detection probl ems mentioned in monitoring personnel 
for contamination also apply to monitoring material. An added problem is that uranium contamination may be located in areas not accessible to survey.  DOE requires that materials used in Contamination Areas, High Contamination 
Areas, and Airborne Radioact ivity Areas that are being released for unrestricted 
use have accessible surfaces surveyed. Materials with inaccessible surfaces 
having a potential for internal contamin ation shall not be released without 
evaluating the material on a case-by-case ba sis to ensure internal contamination 
does not exist.  
DOE values for release of uranium- cont aminated materials are higher than DOE 
values for release of materials contaminat ed with some other radioactive nuclides 
found in the DOE system, such as plutonium. The difference in these values is due to the relative health risk from e xposure to uranium contamination compared 
with these other nuclides.  Release of materials with the potential for uranium contamination shall only be 
performed by personnel who are trained and authorized to do so. The site 
radiological control organizat ion is responsible for designating and training these 
individuals. 
 
i.  Bioassay Monitoring 
 
Bioassay monitoring, or measuring the amount of radioactivity inside the 
body, can also be a way of determining if there has been a loss of control of DOE-HDBK-1113-2008 
Radiological Safety Training for Uranium Facilities  
Module 104 – Internal Dose Control  
40 uranium contamination. For example, if a person who works in an area with a 
relatively low airborne radioactivity concentration and shows an intake 
consistent with a higher airborne radi oactivity concentration, there may have 
been a previously undetected loss of ai rborne contamination control. Routine 
bioassay monitoring will assist in making these determinations.

41 V.  MODULE 105 - Criticality Safety 
 
A.  Objectives  
EO8  Describe the criticalit y safety control measures fo r uranium, including inventory 
control measures. 
EO9  Identify criticality monitori ng techniques used with uranium. 
 B.  Explanation of Criticality  
Uranium is a fissionable material, which means that it can undergo nuclear fission. Nuclear 
fission is a process in which a very heavy unstable atom primarily splits in two, or 
"fissions”. When an atom fissions, one large atom primarily becomes two smaller atoms, 
between one and seven neutrons are given off, and a great deal of energy in radiation and 
other forms, such as the kinetic energy of the fission fragments, is released. 
 
Some unstable atoms, such as 235U, undergo a small amount of fission without any outside 
influences. This small amount of spontaneous  fission does not presen t a significant hazard 
on its own, but the neutrons from this fission may be absorbed by other fissionable atoms. 
When an atom of fissionable material absorb s a neutron, the already unstable atom gains 
additional energy and becomes even more unsta ble. One way the unstable atom can get rid 
of its excess energy is through fission.  When neutrons from one fission cause fission in  another atom, it is called a chain reaction. 
If the chain reaction is self-sustaining, we call this criticality. Criticality  is a self-sustaining 
nuclear chain reaction. This is an obvious ra diation hazard because of the amount of energy 
given off as gamma radiation and other forms. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

C.  Factors Affecting Criticality  
Criticality depends on several factors, includi ng the enrichment of the material, the shape 
of the material, and surrounding materials, that  may help or hinder fission. Several factors 
which affect the occurrence and magnitude of a criticality: 
 
1.  Quantity of Fissile Material 
 
When dealing with criticality, a common ques tion is “How much material can I work 
with and still be safe?” There is some amount  of the fissile material needed to have a 
criticality. This amount is called the “critical mass.” 
 
2.  Geometry 
 
To avoid a criticality event, the fissile ma terial must not be placed in a shape, or 
geometry, that is favorable to criticality. In general, the lower the surface-to-volume 
ratio is, the greater the o pportunity for criticality. 
 
3.  Reflectors 
 
Sometimes, neutrons that are emitted from the fissile material may run into or 
otherwise interact with an at om outside the fissile materi al and be "bounced back" or 
"reflected" into the fissile material. Materi als such as water, gr aphite (a form of 
carbon), and beryllium are good at reflecting neutrons. If the uranium material is 
surrounded by these reflector materials, critic ality is easier to obt ain. Accordingly, it is 
undesirable to store fissile ma terial where there is potentia l for these materials to be 
present. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

Module 105 - Criticality Safety  
43  
4.  Moderators 
 
Another factor that affects criticality is th e speed of the neutrons from fission. Neutrons 
that are traveling at about the same speed  as the atoms in surrounding materials are 
more easily absorbed by fissile materials. Ma terials that slow the neutrons are known as 
moderators. Examples of good modera tors include water and graphite. 
 
For an example of moderation, consider 235U. This uranium isotope absorbs slow 
neutrons (also called “thermal” neutrons; thes e neutrons travel at the same speed as 
their surroundings) with a rather high probability for absorption. However, 
235U only 
absorbs fast neutrons (those neutrons with high energies th at travel faster than their 
surroundings). Normally fast neutrons are quick ly moderated to lower energies, so that 
238U will not go critical under normal conditions. The fast neutrons must be 
moderated, or slowed, to allow 235U to go critical. 
 
5.  Neutron Absorbers (Poisons) 
 
If neutron absorbers are pres ent (i.e., atoms and molecule s with relatively high neutron 
absorption coefficients), these materials will  remove neutrons from being available to 
begin or sustain criticality. Boron is an exam ple of a frequently used neutron absorber, 
or “poison”. 
 
6.  Concentration or Dens ity of Fissile Material 
 
As the concentration or density of fiss ile material increases, the opportunity for 
criticality increases because of an increased likelihood of neutron interaction with the 
fissile material. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

Module 105 - Criticality Safety  
44  
7.  Enrichment 
 
Enrichment is the separation of isotopes. With  uranium, enrichment is typically referred 
to as increasing the percen tage (by weight) of the 
235U isotope in material to greater 
than that found in natural uranium.  Obviously, the enrichment of uranium plays an  important role in cr iticality because the 
amount of fissile material available for criti cality is greater. For example, the higher the 
enrichment of 235U (i.e., the concentration of 235U in relation to other uranium 
isotopes), the greater the opportunity for criticality. 
  
8.  Volume 
 
The volume of material in which fissile ma terial is in solution can also play an 
important role in preventing criticality. For a given concentration or density of fissile 
material, the amount of fissile material will increase as the volume increases. 
 
9.  Interaction 
 
Neutron interaction in an a rray of containers of fissile material is dependent upon 
geometric factors, including: size, shape, a nd separation of the cont ainers, as well as the 
size and shape of the array. Materials that may surround or be intermingled with the 
containers are also important. A close-pack ed array may become critical if flooded with 
water which will thermalize neutrons. Also, a less closely-packed array may become critical if the water is removed, allowi ng less neutron absorption to take place.  DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

D.  Safety Policies and Controls  
Achieving criticality involves bringing toge ther many factors that promote a sustained 
nuclear chain reaction. To avoid criticality, one should be aware of the conditions that 
would promote a criticality for the particular  materials they encounter, and avoid those 
conditions that promote criticality. 
 
1.  General Criticality Safety Principles 
 
Some things done to promote criticality safety include: 
 
• analyzing work environments to assess the risk of criticality and eliminate likely 
criticality concerns; 
• using carefully planned and approved procedures; 
• providing specific training for those personnel working in areas where fissile 
materials are present; and 
• implementing system design features that ar e favorable to criticality safety. These 
features include: -  using containers with a size and ge ometry that will not allow criticality, 
-  designing piping systems to prevent bu ildup of uranium and prevent criticality, 
- using materials known as poisons to ab sorb neutrons and prevent them from 
being absorbed by the uranium atoms, 
-  controlling material that  surrounds containers or sy stems containing uranium, 
and 
-  controlling uranium inventories. DOE-HDBK-1113-2008

2.  Controlling Uranium Inventories 
 
One method to prevent a criticality is c ontrolling uranium inventories. Inventory 
control involves knowing wher e the uranium is at the f acility and the level of 
enrichment of the uranium. Uranium enriched in 
235U or the presence of 233U is of 
concern for criticality; theref ore, these are materials of c oncern for inventory control. 
Criticality is a concern for 238U if fast neutrons are present. 
 
Loss of control of fissile material presents a threat to criticality safety at the facility 
and, in a worst case scenario, to national s ecurity. It is no secret  that groups throughout 
the world are striving to become nuclear pow ers. Even the appearance of a loss of 
inventory control must be avoided to keep  the public trust an d assure continued 
operations of DOE programs. For these reason s, inventories of fissile material are 
closely monitored.

FOREWORD  
 
This Technical Standard discusses, but does not establish any, requirements for DOE uranium facilities. 
Its purpose is to provide information that will assist DOE and DOE‐contractor health and safety 
professionals in developing programs that will provide an appropriate level of protection to both 
affected  workers  and members  of the public  affected  by DOE  uranium‐handling activities.  This Technical 
Standard provides guides to good practice, updates existing reference material, and discusses practical 
lessons learned relevant to the safe handling, processing, and storage of uranium. The technical 
rationale for the guidance provided herein is explained to allow affected individuals to adapt the recommendations to similar situations throughout the DOE complex. This Technical S tandard provides 
information to assist uranium facilities in complying with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations,  
Part 835 (10 CFR Part 835), Occupational Radiation Protection and various DOE Orders.  This technical 
standard supplements DOE G 441.1‐1 C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) , Radiation Protection Programs Guide for Use 
with Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 835 , Occupational Radiation Protection (DOE, 2011a) and 
DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017, Radiological Control (DOE, 2017b ). 
 
This Technical Standard has been updated to include provisions in the 2007 amendment to 10 CFR Part 835. This amendment updated the dosimetric terms and models for assessing radiation doses, both 
internal and external.  Of particular interest  for this Standard,  the biological transportability  of material is 
now classified in terms of absorption types: F (fast), M (medium) and S (slow). Previously this was 
classified in terms of material class: D (days), W (weeks) and Y (years). Throughout this Standard, 
discussions of previous studies describing the biological transportation of material in the body will 
continue  to use D, W and Y, as appropriate.  Discussions of other  requirements  which  have  not amended 
their dosimetric terms and models continue to use the older terminology.  
 
This Technical Standard does not include every requirement applicable to DOE uranium facilities. 
Individuals  responsible  for developing and implementing radiation  protection  programs  at uranium 
facilities should be knowledgeable of the requirements that apply to their facilities.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Purpose  and Applicability  
 
This Technical Standard provides operational guidance, practical lessons learned and 
experience gained,  guides to  good  practice,  and reference  information  on the safe handling of 
uranium.  The Technical  Standard  provides  information  to assist  uranium  facilities  in complying 
with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 835, Occupational Radiation 
Protection (10 CFR Part 835). This Technical Standard supplements the DOE G 441.1‐1C  Chg 1 
(Admin Chg) , Radiation Protection Programs Guide for Use with Title 10, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 835 ( 2011a ); DOE Orders; and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 , Radiological Control 
(2017b ), and its sole purpose is the protection of workers, the public, and the environment 
from the hazards that are inherent in uranium storage, processing, and handling.  
 
This Technical Standard replaces DOE‐STD‐1136‐ 2017, Guide of Good Practices for 
Occupational Radiological Protection in Uranium Facilities (DOE, 2017a ), providing more 
complete  and current  information  and emphasizing situations  that are typical of DOE’s  current 
operations, including weapons assembly  and disassembly, safe  storage, decontamination, and 
decommissioning (environmental restoration). This Technical Standard may be useful to  
health physicists and other safety professionals. The information presented herein represents 
the best technical information available from within the DOE complex. Except to the extent 
that the guidance presented here is an exact quote from applicable regulations or contract 
requirements, i t is not binding or mandatory. However, judicious use of this Technical 
Standard, in concert with applicable regulatory documents, will help in building a comprehensive and technically‐defensible radiological control program.  
 
1.2 Definitions  
 
A glossary  is provided  in Appendix  A. In all cases, the definitions  provided  in this Technical 
Standard are consistent with those  provided  in 10 CFR Part 835,  its Guides, and DOE‐STD‐ 
1098‐ 2017 (2017 b). 
 
1.3 Discussion  
 
Chapters 2 through 10 provide technical information to assist in safely managing radiological 
hazards associated with uranium operations. The topics covered are those considered by 
representatives of many of DOE’s uranium facilities to be most beneficial: Properties and 
Relative Hazards (Chapter 2), Radiation Protection (Chapter 3), Contamination Control 
(Chapter 4), Internal Dosimetry (Chapter  5), External  Dosimetry (Chapter 6),  Nuclear  Criticality 
Safety  (Chapter  7), Waste  Management  (Chapter  8), Emergenc y Management  (Chapter  9), and 
Decommissioning (Chapter 10).  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 2 PROPERTIES  AND  RELATIVE HAZARDS  
This chapter  presents  basic  radiological and chemical  properties  of uranium  and discusses the 
basis for current control limits. A variety of materials are inherent to uranium handling 
processes and hazards characteristic of these materials and processes. The data and 
discussions are intended to provide a basis for understanding the changes in hazards as a 
function of such p arameters as enrichment, physical form, and chemical form.  
 
2.1 Nuclear  Properties  of Uranium  
 
Naturally occurring uranium consists of a mixture of 234U, 235U, and 238U isotopes, along with 
their decay products. Uranium is relatively abundant in nature. The primary isotopes of uranium are long‐lived alpha‐emitters with energies between 4.15 and 4.8 MeV. Their 
progeny  include  numerous  other  radionuclides,  some  of which  are radiologically  significant  at 
uranium facilities, the degree of significance depending upon the history of the uranium 
materials and the processing.  
 
Through proper processing, uranium can be used as a fuel in nuclear reactors to generate electricity on a commercially  viable scale, to produce radioisotopes, to provide steam for 
propulsion, and radiation for research. The 
235U isotope readily  undergoes  fission by slow, 
"thermal" neutrons with the release of a large amount of energy. The percentage of 235U 
present (referred to as "enrichment") determines the fuel reactivity and the criticality hazard of the material. By concentrating the amount of the 
235U isotope in the uranium, the quantity 
of fuel and the size of the reactor needed for power production decreases. This concentration of natural uranium to enriched uranium is carried out by special processes such as gaseous 
diffusion,  centrifuging,  or laser  separation.  The uranium  by‐product  of the enrichment  process 
is reduced  in 
235U content  and is called  "depleted"  uranium.  Uranium  is commonly  classified  by 
its 235U enrichment as natural uranium, enriched uranium, or depleted uranium.  
 
Uranium‐235 fissions after capturing a thermal (very low energy) neutron. Its fission thermal 
cross‐section  (probability  of interaction)  is 577 barns (Stehn  et al., 1965).  Its neutron  capture 
cross  section  is 101 barns.  After  capturing a fast neutron,  238U undergoes  two successive  beta 
decays to 239Pu which will also undergo thermal fission (thermal cross‐section = 741 barns). 
Heavy‐water moderated reactors function with natural uranium isotopic composition. Other types of reactors require some 
235U enrichment.  
 
2.1.1 Isotopic  Characterization 
 
Natural uranium  consists  of three isotopes:  238U, 235U, and 234U. All three radionuclides  undergo 
radioactive decay by alpha particle emission. The 235U isotope (and 234U to a much lesser 
degree and at lower energy) emits gamma radiation as well. The natural abundances of these 
uranium isotopes, as well as the weight percentages of the isotopes in enriched (typical 
commercial nuclear power reactor enrichment) and depleted uranium, are listed in Table 2‐1.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

The amount of uranium present determines the grade of the ore. Most of the ores found in 
the U.S. contain from 0.1 to 1%  uranium and are considered medium grade.  Lower‐grade ores 
are mined  commercially  if they  are a byproduct  of mining for another  material,  such  as gold or 
phosphate.  
 
Uranium  that has been  processed to raise  the concentration  of 235U is referred  to as enriched 
uranium. The extent of enrichment depends on the intended end use of the uranium.  
Commercial light water reactors are designed for use with the 235U enriched to around 3%. 
Higher enrichment is required for; high‐temperature gas‐cooled reactors, naval nuclear propulsion reactors, most research reactors and weapons. The 
235U enrichment process also 
increases  the concentration  of 234U. The higher  activity  of enriched uranium  is due more  from 
the increased 234U than from the increased 235U. 
 
Depleted uranium is a by‐product of the enrichment process and is depleted in both the 235U 
and 234U isotopes. Depleted  uranium,  with  its reduced  activity  and very  high  density,  has many 
uses; among them are radiation shielding, counterweights, projectiles, and target elements in 
DOE plutonium production reactors.  
 
In addition  to the uranium  isotopes  discussed above,  the daughter  products  of uranium  decay 
and byproducts of uranium processing can have significant radiological impacts in uranium‐ handling facilities. Table 2‐2 presents the properties of these radionuclides.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 2.1.2 Decay  Chains  
 
The natural uranium isotopes decay by alpha emission. The decay products are also 
radioactive  and form  "decay  chains"  that ultimately  lead  to a stable  isotope  of lead.  Figures  2‐ 
1 and 2‐2 present  the decay  chains of 238U and 235U (234U is a member  of the 238U decay chain), 
along with the half‐lives and characteristic radiations of each nuclide.  
 
Uranium‐processing steps (milling or refining) separate the decay products and other 
impurities in the ore from the uranium. It takes months after processing before the first few 
decay products build up and come to equilibrium with the parents. In depleted  uranium, the 
beta radiation from the decay of 234Th and 234mPa amounts to nearly twice the alpha radiation 
from  238U and 234U. In commercially  enriched  uranium,  the beta  radiation  from  231Th, 234Th, and 
234mPa nearly  equals  the alpha radiation  from  238U, 234U, and 235U. In natural ore, the later decay 
products (especially 230Th and 226Ra) are present and add significant gamma radiation to the 
emitted radiation. In processed uranium (natural, enriched, or depleted) all decay products below 
234U and 235U are removed. Because of the long half‐lives of 234U and 231Pa, the 
radionuclides that follow these two nuclides are generally ignored.  
 
The mining and milling  stages  are usually  conducted  by commercial enterprises.  DOE  facilities 
do not routinely process uranium ore concentrates and, as a result, the decay products 
formed during DOE processing operations of virgin feed are limited. However, radium and its 
progeny may be present in wastewater streams of certain facilities , so it is prudent to 
consider those nuclides in effluent and environmental monitoring programs.  
 
For workplace radiological controls, 234Th, 234mPa, 231Th and the uranium isotopes are those 
requiring  primary  consideration;  however,  if there are large  quantities  of aged  highly  enriched 
uranium, there may be a need to also consider 231Pa in establishing radiological controls. In 
addition, elevated radon concentrations can occur in poorly ventilated uranium storage areas from the small amounts of 
226Ra that grow in and carry over as contaminants in the chemical 
separation processes.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 2.1.3 Enrichment  
 
Uranium‐235  enrichment  processes  selectively  increase  the 235Uconcentration  by separating  it 
from the 238U. The method used for many years in the U.S. is the gaseous diffusion process.  
Laser separation has also been demonstrated in this country, but a facility built to 
accommodate the process has not yet been brought on‐line. Centrifugation is a third 
separation method used by foreign sources. Uranium feed for the enrichment process is derived from virgin ore or from "very clean" recycled material. Although some uranium is still 
mill‐derived, much of the feed is recycled material from other countries, including Canada (where natural uranium is the reactor feed material). Specifications on  acceptable 
contamination  levels  limit  the feed  that may  be processed  in the U.S. gaseous  diffusion  plants. 
Recycling of reprocessed (irradiated uranium) material from DOE’s reactors years ago contaminated the diffusion process equipment with transuranics, a portion of which remains in the equipment.  
 
The specific activity of essentially pure uranium depends on its degree of enrichment and normally  describes  only  alpha activity. The beta  activity  from  associated  decay  products  is not 
included in the uranium specific activity values, but is expressed separately. Consequently, 
two specific activities (one for alpha and one for beta) are frequently calculated for uranium‐ 
bearing materials. Some typical alpha specific activity values are given in Table 2‐3.  
 
Table  2‐3. Uranium  Specific Activities  
 
Type  Wt. % 235U Specific  Activity  of 
Mixture (Ci/g)  
Natural  0.71 7 x 10‐7 
Depleted  0.2 4 x 10‐7 
Enriched  2 1 x 10‐6 
Highly  Enriched  20 9 x 10‐6 
 
For gaseous  diffusion  enriched uranium,  the approximate  alpha  specific  activity  of a given 
uranium enrichment can be calculated from the following formula:  
 
Specific  Activity  of Enriched  Uranium  = (0.4  + 0.38E  + 0.0034E2) x 10-6 Ci/g; 
where  E = %235U by weight,  enrichment  ≥ 0.72  
 
Gaseous diffusion,  the predominant  existing  enrichment  technology,  causes  a greater increase 
in 234U concentration than in 235Uconcentration. For example, when 235Ucontent is increased 
from 0.72% (natural) to 2.96%, (an increase of approximately a factor of four),  234Ucontent 
increases from 0.006% to 0.03%, (a five‐fold increase). As a result, the specific activity 
increases with enrichment, not just because of the replacement of some 238U with 235U, but 
more significantly because of the increase in the amount of 234Upresent.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
9  
 Laser isotopic  separation  (under  research)  selectively  enriches  only  the 235U, leaving  the 234U 
with the "tails," or depleted uranium. Therefore, the radiological characteristics of both 
enriched and depleted uranium will change when compared to conventional separation 
techniques.  
 
The specific activity of recycled irradiated uranium varies from the value calculated from the equation given above because that equation is not applicable to recycled material with its 
added contaminants.  For these  reasons,  specific  activities  that are calculated  from  the formula 
should be considered approximations only. If exact values of specific activity are required,  
they should be determined analytically. See Example 1 for the calculation of blending enrichments. 
 
 
 
As a historical  note,  some of  the earlier documentation  refers  to the "special curie"  of natural 
uranium, which  was defined  as 3.7 x  1010 d/s of  234U, 3.7 x 1010 d/s of  238U, and 1.7 x 109 d/s of 
235U. Thus, 1 "curie" of natural uranium was actually slightly more than 2 curies of uranium 
alpha activity. This essentially obsolete term has caused considerable confusion. Readers are 
cautioned to be aware  of the use of this special curie  in the older  literature.  Use of this unit in 
any current application is strongly discouraged.  
 
2.1.4 Contaminants  from  Recycled  Uranium  and Associated  Hazards  
 
Some of the uranium feed material that was handled at DOE facilities had been reclaimed or recycled from reprocessed, spent reactor fuel. The chemical processes by which recycled uranium  was purified  left trace  amounts  of transuranic  elements  (neptunium,  americium,  and 
plutonium) and fission products (mainly 
99Tc). The recycled uranium also contained trace 
amounts of uranium isotopes not found in nature, such as 236U. At the minute concentration 
levels in uranium from fuel reprocessing facilities, the radiological impact of these impurities  
Example  1 
 
One kilogram  of 20%  enriched uranium  is blended with  1 kilogram  of 2% enriched 
uranium.  
 
 
 
 
 
The specific  activity  of the resulting  mixture  is

 was negligible  in most  cases.  However,  there  were  many  routine  chemical  processes  that 
tended to concentrate these impurities, either in the uranium product or in reaction by‐ 
products, such that radiological controls and environmental monitoring programs must 
consider these impurities.  
 
The Derived  Air Concentration  (DAC)  values  for several  radionuclides  are shown in Table  2‐4. 
These include the three uranium isotopes and selected contaminants in recycled uranium.  
 
The following  text discusses  the environmental,  safety,  and health  challenges  presented  by 
the introduction of recycled uranium into the DOE system for enrichment.  
 
2.1.4.1  Transuranics  
 
Transuranics (neptunium and plutonium isotopes) exist in small quantities in reclaimed or 
recycled feed materials. In most cases, a regimen of radiological controls based on uranium 
hazards is adequate to control the additional activity. However, because o f their higher 
specific activities (compared to uranium isotopes), transuranics can represent a significant internal dose concern even at very low mass concentrations. As a result, the annual limit on 
intakes (ALI) for transuranics are lower than those for uranium isotopes. For example, for a 
moderately soluble transportability mixture, if 
239Pu contamination contributes 0.1% of the 
total  alpha  activity  in uranium,  then  it will contribute  roughly  14%  of the total  inhalation  dose 
equivalent  (see Example  2). Example  2 illustrates  that it takes  only  11 parts  of 239Pu per billion 
parts of natural uranium to attain an activity fraction of 0.1%.  
 
Radiological controls  based  solely  on uranium  content  may  provide  insufficient  protection 
with increases in the TRU concentration. Processes to recover uranium from by‐product 
streams recover  a portion of  the impurities as  well and may  require  additional controls  to 
adequately protect individuals when the TRU concentration exceeds 0.1%.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

Example  2 
 
One gram  of natural uranium contains 239Pu contamination  to the extent that the 239Pu 
activity  is 0.1%  of the uranium  alpha  activity. The relative  inhalation  hazards  of the two 
materials are determined by dividing each material’s relative activity by its derived air 
concentration. 
 
U‐Nat  relative  activity  = 1 
 
239 
Pu relative  activity  = 0.001  
 
U‐Nat  derived  air concentration  (M) = 3 x 10‐10 µCi/mL  (use  DAC  for 238U) 
239 
Pu derived  air concentration  (M) = 5 x 10‐12µCi/mL  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
These  values  represent  the relative  hazards  of the two materials  in the mixture.  
 
 DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
12  
  
 
 
Several DOE facilities have adopted specifications on recycled uranium that limit the amount 
of transuranic alpha activity to 0.1% of the total uranium alpha activity, thus limiting the potential inhalation dose from transuranics to a small fraction of the total. Facilities that 
handle  recycled  uranium  with  higher  levels  of transuranics  should establish  a regular program 
of analyzing feeds, products, and by‐products for transuranics, and then modifying control 
limits and action levels as appropriate to reflect the transuranic content of those materials.  
This monitoring  of the TRU content is essential  when  the analytical  technique  used  to identify 
the level of radiological control needed is based on gross alpha counting (such as for air sampling), which does not distinguish the plutonium from the uranium fraction, or chemical 
analysis for uranium (such as photofluorometric urinalysis) which does not detect plutonium.  
 
Raffinate from refinery operations, MgF
2 from metal production operations, and chemical 
traps from UF 6 operations have all been observed to have higher TRU‐to‐U  ratios than  either 
reactants/feeds or uranium products. Frequently, reaction by‐products are not discarded as 
wastes but are processed further to recover the remaining uranium. When this occurs, a 
portion of the impurities is recovered along with the uranium and can b ecome a perpetual 
radiological control problem. All facilities that process recycled uranium should periodically 
analyze  feeds,  products,  and by‐products  for transuranics  to ensure  that radiological controls 
are adequate for the mixtures of uranium and transuranic elements that are present.  
 
The uranium  isotopes  (viewed  as contaminants)  that will increase  due to the recycled  uranium 
feed are 232U, 234U, and 236U. The health and safety risks of 236U are similar to those of natural 
uranium because its specific activity and radiation emissions are similar (See Table 2‐2). Its 
presence in uranium fuel requires slightly higher enrichments for the same reactor 
applications, however, because it absorbs neut rons. The increased concentration of the 234U 
increases the specific activity of any enrichment of 235U. It is expected that the specific activity 
for a given  enrichment  would  be about  double  that obtained from  enrichment  of non‐recycled 
uranium.  
Therefore,  239Pu at 0.1%  of the U‐Nat  activity  represents  6% of the potential  inhalation  
dose.  
 
The activity  of 1 gram  of U‐Nat  = 2.5 x 104 dps 
 
Therefore,  the 239Pu activity  in the 1 gram  of U‐Nat.=  0.001  x 2.5 x 104 = 25 dps 
 
239 
The specific  activity  of Pu is 2.27  dps/nanogram:  
/ / 
 
Therefore,  0.1%  239Pu activity  fraction  corresponds  to 11 parts  per billion  on a mass  
basis.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
13  
  
The isotope in recycled uranium presenting the greatest potential radiological hazard from 
external sources is 232U. 232U is a daughter product of neutron activation of 231Pa. The health 
hazards of 232U are primarily due to the rapid buildup of gamma activity of its decay products, 
particularly from  228Th. The gamma activity  buildup  is both  time‐  and process‐dependent. The 
232U decay products form nonvolatile fluorides and will concentrate in cylinders when UF 6 is 
vapor‐fed. The gamma activity in equipment that processes gaseous UF 6 is a function of the 
mass fraction of 232U present in the gas phase. Estimates indicate that the level of gamma 
activity within the enrichment cascade equipment would increase by about a factor of 3 due to the presence of 
232U. The exposure rates on internal surfaces would increase from 10‐20 
mrad/h  to 30‐60  mrad/h;  those  on external  surfaces  would  increase  to about  3‐4 mrad/h.  The 
major exposure increase from the 232U occurs in the handling of UF 6 cylinders. Currently, the 
exposure rate at the external surface of empty UF 6 cylinders is about 50‐100 mrad/h.  
Assuming a 232U concentration of 0.5 ppm based on 235U and a feed enrichment of 1%, a full 
10‐ton feed cylinder would have a surface exposure rate of about 80 mrad/h. The exposure rate at 30 cm from  the surface  of an emptied  cylinder  would  be about  500 mrad/h  without  the 
shielding provided by material in the cylinder. These values are based on the 
232U being in 
secular equilibrium with its decay products; in reality, it is unlikely that the decay products would reach much more than 50% of equilibrium values . 
 
Product  cylinders  produced  from processing of  recycled  uranium typically have higher gamma 
radiation  fields  than  the feed  cylinders.  At 4% 235U enrichment,  the contribution  from  232U over 
time could increase the radiation field at the surface from 80 mrad/h to 300 mrad/h from a 
full 10‐ton cylinder and from 500 mrad/h at 30 cm to 2 rad/h from an empty cylinder. About 
half of this increase would be apparent within 2 years of initial usage and the highest levels 
could  occur  in 20 years  without  mitigating  actions.  Frequent  cylinder  cleaning  can prevent  this 
significant ex posure rate buildup. The presence of 232Umay also require other changes in 
processes used to handle cleaning solutions due to the higher gamma radiation present.  
 
2.1.4.2  Technetium  
 
In facilities  with  significant  quantities  of 99Tc, radiation  monitoring  techniques  must  be able  to 
detect the low‐energy beta radiation from this isotope. Individual and area monitoring equipment  and techniques  selected  to measure  the 2.29  MeV  (E
max) beta  from  234mPa may  not 
measure the 99Tc 0.292 MeV (E max) beta effectively. If a mixture of uranium and 99Tc is 
suspected to be present, the monitoring technique selected must be based on 99Tc or on the 
actual mixture, rather than on 234mPa. The 99Tc levels have not been the controlling factor in 
many situations to date. However, it is important to ensure that monitoring instruments and 
techniques are adequate to detect 99Tc. 
 
Technetium‐99  tends  to deposit  within  enrichment  equipment  and will "pocket"  in the higher 
enrichment sections of the gaseous diffusion cascade. Special precautions must be taken  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
14  
 when evacuating and purging or performing other maintenance work on this equipment. In 
equipment with accumulations of 99Tc, low energy beta radiation fields of a few rad per hour 
may be encountered. This radiation is effectively attenuated by the protective clothing 
required for contamination control (one pair of industrial cloth coveralls, one pair of 
impermeable (Tyvek) c overalls, heavy neoprene gloves, and safety glasses). While the 99Tc 
should be effectively removed from the Gaseous Diffusion Plant (GD P) product, it will be 
present in uranium used by  other DOE facilities. Because  the ALI for  99Tc is higher  than that  of 
uranium,  inhalation  is the controlling  concern  only  in situations  where  the technetium  activity 
greatly exceeds that of the uranium that is present. Technetium as pertechnetate is also 
difficult to remove from skin and can therefore cause significant doses to the skin from 
contamination.  
 
The tendency of technetium to become airborne more readily than uranium can lead to beta 
contamination  in areas  where  it is not otherwise expected . This may result in environmental 
emissions  even when the uranium is effectively confined in the work place. Residues in 
ventilation systems from high‐temperature operations, such as uranium remelting/casting, or 
uranium chip burning, tend to have higher Tc‐to‐U ratios than either feed or product material 
in uranium metal  processing  facilities.  Because  of its low atomic  weight  and relative  volatility,  
technetium also tends to concentrate at the top of the gaseous diffusion cascade, where it 
becomes an inhalation and effluent concern when the cascade is opened for maintenance. 
Facilities that handle  recycled  uranium  should  1) analyze  feeds,  products,  and by‐products  to 
determine the fate of 99Tc within their processes, then 2) modify monitoring equipment, 
control limits, and action levels as needed to properly evaluate and control 99Tc hazards.  
 
Environment, safety, and health personnel should also evaluate the presence of and 
radiological consequences  from  other  fission  products  impurities  in recycled  uranium.  
 
2.2 Physical  and Chemical  Properties  
 
Uranium fuels vary with reactor type. Some reactors use the natural isotopic composition in 
the fuel. Others use enrichment varying from 2% to > 90%. Because of the radiation‐induced 
growth of uranium metal used in the early reactors, alloys were developed to stabilize 
dimensional changes. Many of the alloys with favorable dimensional stability characteris tics 
had sizeable  neutron  absorption  cross‐sections, resulting  in poisoning of the nuclear  reaction. 
Zirconium alloy‐clad ceramic uranium dioxide and uranium carbide fuels were found to have 
acceptable characteristics and are in common use.  
 
2.2.1 Uranium  Fuel  Processing  
 
The process of reducing uranium ore to metal begins with the discovery and mining of uranium in ore bodies. Most medium grade ore consists of oxides of uranium, of which 
carnotite  (K
2(UO 2)2(VO 2.3H 2O)) is predominant.  Although  some  ore is mined  using  in situ leach 
techniques, most is hard‐rock mined with a small amount removed by open pit mining.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
15  
 Uranium ore is milled by crushing, leaching, extracting, and precipitating, usually to 
ammonium diuranate ((NH 4)2U2O7) commonly called yellow cake. The radioactivity of this 
product  is low because  the decay  products  have  been  stripped  away  and it is in an unenriched 
form. The yellow cake is purified and converted to UF 4 and then further fluorinated to 
uranium hexafluoride (UF 6). Gaseous diffusion enrichment changes the uranium isotopic, but 
not the chemical,  composition  of the gas. The UF 6 is hydrolyzed  to uranyl oxyfluoride,  which  is 
precipitated with an ammonia solution to ammonium diuranate. This precipitate is filtered or 
centrifuged, dried, and calcined. The uranium compound is reduced to UO 2 powder, which is 
pelletized, sintered, and encapsulated in tubes for reactor usage.  
 
Laser enrichment  can use feed  forms  including metal  and UF6. 
 
Steel was an early cladding material that was discontinued because of its thermal‐neutron poison characteristics. Fuel bundles used in commercial LWRs are now made of fuel pins that 
consist of pellets of UO
2. The pellets are stacked into free‐standing cladding tubes of a 
zirconium  alloy.  Differences  in fuel design  between  the two common  types  of nuclear reactors 
in use in the United States, pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors 
(BWRs), are rod diameter and cladding thickness.  
 
Reactor  fuel for the Canadian  pressurized  heavy  water  reactors  (CANDU‐PHWR)  is similar  but 
the cladding need not be free‐standing. Additionally, the fuel pins are smaller in diameter.  
Breeder  reactors  like the Fast Flux Test  Facility  (FFTF)  use a mixture of PuO 2 and depleted  UO 2. 
In the case of the FFTF, the pellets are loaded  into stainless steel cladding tubes (which have  a 
smaller effect on fast neutrons).  
 
Uranium carbide (UC 2) microspheres were developed as an alternative to UO 2, primarily for 
the high‐temperature  gas‐cooled  reactor.  These fuel particles,  developed  for high  thermal  and 
radiation stability, prevent the release of fuel and fission products over a wide range of 
conditions.  
 
2.2.2 Uranium  Metal  
 
Conversion of UF 6 to uranium metal involves, first, the production of UF 4, commonly called 
green  salt. Enriched  uranium  green  salt is reacted  with  granular calcium  to produce  metal  slag. 
This product is then reacted with magnesium or calcium to reduce the material to metal.  
Depleted  uranium  green  salt is more  commonly  reacted  with  magnesium  to produce  DU metal 
as a derby.  In both  cases,  most  of the uranium  decay  products  are concentrated  in the calcium 
or magnesium slag, leaving the metal relatively pure and with a reduced level of radioactivity. 
Buildup of decay products to near‐equilibrium levels takes about six months.  
 
The metallic  uranium  is processed  into desired  forms  using  machining,  melting,  casting,  and 
other treatments. This very dense metal is usually alloyed with another metal for greater 
stability. Uranium is a reactive metal that oxidizes easily. In the newly minted metal, a very  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
16  
 thin surface layer tends to undergo rapid oxidation. This surface layer may protect the rest of 
the metal from further corrosion and prevent the generation of removable contamination. Certain environmental conditions, particularly moist air and saline solu tions, can accelerate 
the corrosion  of the material over  time  and produce  greater  possibility  for generating  airborne 
radioactive material. Stored in a dry environment or coated with an anti‐corrosion surface treatment, the metal may show no visible signs of corrosion for many years.  Uranium metal 
chips and turnings are pyrophoric and tend to catch fire.  
 
Uranium  metal  may  be dissolved  using nitric  acid,  which  is also used  to passivate  ("pickle")  the 
metal to inhibit oxidation.  
 
2.3 Radiological  Characteristics  and Effects  
 
Uranium isotopes decay by alpha particle emission and some also emit low‐energy gamma 
rays.  For Types  M and S material (See  last paragraph of Section  2.5 for discussion of Type  F, M 
and S), the inhalation hazard from alpha particle release in the respiratory tract is the 
predominant radiological hazard associated with the alpha‐emitting uranium isotopes. The 
primary uranium decay products, listed in Table 2‐2, decay by beta particle emission, most 
with a small yield of gamma emissions as well. These decay products increase the shallow dose and lens of the eye dose resulting from external radiation exposures, due mainly to the  
2.29 MeV (E
max) beta from 234mPa.The surface dose rates shown in Table 2‐5 result primarily 
from beta radiation from decay products. The dose rates decrease quickly with distance 
because  of the attenuation  of the beta  radiation  and the small yield  of the gamma  radiation.

Because some  uranium  decay  products  have  short  half‐lives  (on the order  of days),  those  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
17  
 decay products will usually be present with uranium during processing. An assumption of 
secular equilibrium should not be made until processing is complete because many routine 
chemical processing steps separate uranium from its decay products. Both the in halation and 
external exposure hazards associated with the decay products are increased in areas where 
the decay products are concentrated. The overall inhalation hazard will typically decrease in 
those areas as the uranium is removed. In the case of cast uranium metal, the exposure rates 
from  high  beta  levels  from  decay  products  may  be many  orders  of magnitude  greater than  the 
exposure rates from the uranium.  
 
2.3.1 Alpha‐Neutron External  Hazard 
 
The interaction of alpha particles from uranium with the nuclei of fluorine and other low‐Z 
atoms  generates  neutrons  of approximately  2‐MeV  energy.  The magnitude  of the neutron  flux 
varies, based on the total activity of uranium (which is a function of enrichment) and the 
chemical compound  in question  (mixing of  U and F). In  the case of UF 6, the typically  measured 
neutron dose rates for cooled storage cylinders are as follows:  
Natural‐5% enrichment:  0.01‐0.2 mrem/h 
Very high enrichment (>97%):  2‐4 mrem/h  (contact)  
1‐2 mrem/h  (3 ft) 
 
The preceding values were measured with a 9‐in. spherical BF 3 rem meter. In general, the 
exposure potential of personnel to neutrons generated by the (alpha, n) reaction is not high. However, if personnel are required to spend more than a few hours per week in close 
proximity to containers of uranium fluoride compou nds or if their assignments require them 
to spend time near storage or processing areas for large quantities of uranium fluoride 
compounds,  the exposure to neutrons  should  be evaluated.  This is parti cularly  necessary  since 
the personnel monitoring badges may not be neutron‐sensitive or may need to be calibrated to the specific spectra. Penetrating radiation exposures from photon radiation will not be indicative of neutron exposures. This is because the higher photon pe netrating radiation 
exposures tend to be associated with used but empty containers, where decay products have 
plated out on the sides, while the maximum neutron exposures are associated with full 
containers. There is a small additional ne utron flux from spontaneous fission associated with 
full containers. Neutron sensitive personnel monitoring badges are recommended for 
operations dealing with uranium fluoride compounds.  
 
2.3.2 Mode  of Uranium  Entry  into the Body  
 
Work practices are designed to control radiation exposure to levels that are as low as is 
reasonably achievable (ALARA). Reductions in exposure time and increases in shielding help 
reduce external doses. Effective contamination control techniques and ventilation/filtering 
systems  help  reduce  airborne  radioactive  material concentrations  and resulting internal doses.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
18  
 Where complete contamination control is not reasonable, internal exposure of uranium 
compounds as aerosols or deposited particulates may occur. The effects of uranium exposure 
on the body depend on the mode of exposure.  External exposure concerns are limited to beta 
and gamma emissions, of which the gamma field is quite low and the beta field may be 
mitigated  using protective clothing including safety  glasses  with  side shields.  Internal  exposure 
and its potential effects through radiological or chemical toxicity depend on the route of  
entry, and its distribution depends on the solubility of the material. Solubility is complicated  
by the wide  variety of stoichiometric and crystalline uranium compounds. Inhalation and 
ingestion  are most  commonly  assessed  as routes  of entry.  Although  not covered  here,  entry  of 
uranium into wounds is also a concern, and its distribution depends on its solubility (See 
sections 5.9 and 5.10 for further discussion). Absorption through intact skin is unlikely. The 
type of radiation to which the body is exposed and the length of th e exposure determine the 
biological effect of the radiation exposure.  
 
2.3.2.1  Inhalation  
 
Inhalation hazards from uranium result primarily from the alpha emissions. Inhalation of 
uranium particles and deposition into the respiratory system are dependent on particle size. 
The nasal‐pharynx system filters out most large particles that are still s mall enough to be 
inhaled. Larger particles can be inhaled‐‐a common convention is to assume inhalation 
possible for all particles 10‐µm or less aerodynamic equivalent diameter (AED)‐‐but most 
particles that penetrate to the lower respiratory tract are les s than 3‐ or 4‐µm AED. Uranium  
in the lungs has been shown to exhibit a wide range of retention values. Clearance may occur 
through physical processes removing particles that are not embedded into the lung by cilia 
motion to the esophagus. Uranium particles that are soluble in lung flui d are chemically 
dissolved, and the ions are transported into the bloodstream where they are further 
distributed. Uranium particles remaining in the lung constitute a potential radiological hazard 
as they impart their alpha e mission energy into the surrounding absorbing tissue, potentially 
causing significant  damage  within  a small sphere  around  each  particle.  Particles  removed  from 
the lung to the bloodstream primarily represent a potential chemical hazard.  
 
The significance of these hazards is evaluated using models of uptake and removal 
recommended  by national  and international scientific  radiation  protection  organizations.  The 
lung model described in International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) 
Publication 66 (1994a) uses solubility Types of F (fast), M (moderate), and S (slow). In 
comparison to previous models, this model better describes deposition, retention , and 
clearance data and decouples physical and chemical clearance processes.  
 
2.3.2.2  Ingestion  
 
Appropriate uranium contamination controls should prevent ingestion of uranium. 
Nevertheless,  the potential  exists  for accidental  ingestion  of uranium.  Particles  removed  from 
the respiratory tract by ciliary action are transferred to the gastrointestinal tract.  Particles  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
19  
 inhaled  through  the mouth  and temporarily  deposited  there are removed  from  the respiratory 
system to the esophagus. Deposition and removal of ingested uranium are approximated  
using the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract Model adapted from Eve (1966). This model calculates 
material transferred from the GI tract to the blood based on solubility classes (ICRP, 1979; 
IAEA, 1994) or based on a single value for all compounds, as described in ICRP Publication 69 
(1995a).  
 
Distribution  of uranium  transferred  into the bloodstream  is calculated  using a once‐through 
metabolic model. ICRP Publication 30 (1979) also provides values for this distribution and 
excretion to calculate committed doses and long‐term tissue retention. Recent models (Wrenn  et al., 1994;  ICRP,  1995a)  have  been  developed  to include  recycling  of uranium  back 
into the blood.  
 
2.4 Chemical  Toxicity  
 
The chemical toxicity of uranium is a primary concern in establishing control limits. A heavy metal, uranium is chemically toxic to kidneys and exposure to soluble (transportable) 
compounds  can result  in renal injury.  The factors  to be considered  in determining whether  the 
chemical or radiological hazard is controlling are the enrichment, mode of entry, and the 
solubility/transportability of the material. Epidemiological and toxicological animal studies of 
oral exposure to relatively soluble naturally occurring isotopic mixtures appear demonstrate 
that the health effects are chemical  toxicity to tissues; while those from inhalation exposure 
may include a slight radiological component, especially if the exposure is chronic (ATSDR, 2013). For inhalation of relatively insoluble uranium compounds, the radiological hazard can 
be the most l imiting due to an increased residence time in the lungs and low fractional 
absorption to blood (Leggett, et. al., 2012).  
 
A concentration of 3 µg of uranium per gram (µg U/g) of kidney tissue has traditionally been 
used as the guideline for controlling the chemical toxicity of uranium. Reference man has a 
kidney mass of 310 g, so this concentration translates to a total kidne y burden of 1 mg. A 
review of the literature by Leggett (1989) suggests that worker exposure to 2 to 6 µg U/g 
kidney might be tolerated with no serious effects. However, he emphasizes that this range is 
not necessarily the same as the level causing no detectable damage. He concludes that a 
lower limit would be prudent until more of the physiological mechanisms of response to 
uranium in the kidney are better understood. Other studies (McGuire, 1991) report that 
detectable effects from an intake of soluble uranium of 10 mg or less is unlikely and that an 
intake  of 40 mg and perhaps  as high  as 100 mg is unlikely  to cause  permanent  damage.  Other 
evaluations of toxicity to the kidney concluded that a limit of 1.0 µg U/g kidney is consistent 
with results in the re cent literature.  
 
Data on human exposures and the effect of various intakes of uranium are summarized in 
Table  5‐7. These  data  indicate  that a single  intake  of 8 mg of natural  uranium would  be well DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
20  
 below  the level  that could cause  permanent kidney damage  in most  individuals, and that  4 mg 
intake would likely cause no observable effects. The urine levels for situations in which 
chemical toxicity  might  be of concern  are based  on interpretation  of the data  (McGuire,  1991).

(1994b).  
(d) See discussion  in (Just  and Elmer,  1984)  
 
An airborne concentration limit of 0.2 mg/m3 was adopted by the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)  for occupational exposures,  based  on the 3 µg/gm  of tissue  value. The Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted a limit of 0.05 mg/m
3 for soluble 
uranium and 0.25 mg/m3 for insoluble uranium. In DOE regulated facilities, the more 
conservative of the two standards (OSHA or ACGIH) must be used unless enrichment and solubility dictate more stringent controls based on radiolog ical concerns. Table 2‐6 lists 
airborne  concentration  limits  for transportable  uranium  that have  been  published  by various 
organizations.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

(b) Preferred/recommended  limit. 
 
Past limits for single acute inhalation intakes have been set by the ICRP in its Publication 6, 
(1964) to 2.5 mg of soluble uranium inhaled in any one day. This value is based on one day’s 
intake  at the maximum  permissible  concentration  (at the time)  of 210 µg/m3. Lawrence  (1984) 
derived acute inhalation intake limits of 15 and 80 mg for Type F and Type M materials, 
respectively. This derivation is based on not exceeding a kidney burden of 3 µg U/g kidney 
after a single acute inhalation. NRC regulations at 10 CFR Part 20 limit the intake of soluble uranium to 10 mg in a week.  
 
Chronic exposure to a concentration of 0.2 mg/m
3 results in a weekly intake of 9.6 mg (40 
h/week  x 1.2 m3/h x 0.2 mg/m3) and a steady‐state kidney  burden  of roughly  900 µg, when  the 
ICRP Publication 68 (1994b) metabolic model for Type F uranium is used. This same model indicates that an acute intake of 18 mg will result in a prompt kidney burden of approximately 
900 µg. However, 10 CFR Part 20 limits acute exposures to 40 DAC‐hour s, or 9.6 mg.  
 
Recurrent  concerns  have  arisen  about  the adequacy  of existing  limits  intended  to prevent 
chemical damage to kidneys. These concerns have focused particularly on the  
 
a. Lack  of data  on the effects  of combined exposures  to UO 2F2 and HF. 
 
b. Lack  of detailed  information  on effects  of short‐term  exposures  to soluble/transportable  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
22  
 uranium  in the range  from  100‐1000  mg /m3. 
 
c. Lack  of data  on thresholds  for repairable  injury.  
 
DOE  sponsored  research  to determine the exposure  levels  that would  be expected  to 1) have 
no effect, 2) cause non‐lethal injury, and 3) be lethal to 50% of the exposed population (LD 
50). Researcher  consensus  resulted  in the kidney  burdens  (in µg U/g Kidney)  listed  in Table  2‐ 
7. 
 
Table  2‐8. Uranium  Levels  for Various  Effects

No effect  1.1 0.337  6.5 
Maximal Nonlethal  2.2 0.71 13 
LD50 54.8 16.79  322 
 
The kidney burden values can be used to derive an intake based on the ICRP Publication 78 (1997), model for uranium metabolism (62% of inhaled Type F uranium is taken up into the 
bloodstream  (82%  deposited  – 62%  systemic and 20%  to GI tract)  and 8.5%  of that goes  to the 
kidneys).  For example, the "no effect" value in Table 2.7 corresponds to an intake of (1.1μg 
U/g)(310 g/kidney)(1000 μg/mg)/((0.62 fraction systemic)(.085 fraction systemic going to kidney) = 6.5 mg.  
 
An airborne contamination limit from this "no effect" kidney burden can be derived by 
calculating  the airborne  uranium  concentration  at which  chronic  exposure  would  result  in a 
kidney burden that just equals the "no effect" burden.  
 
For chronic exposure to a constant concentration, the maximum kidney burden will occur at the equilibrium  condition‐‐when  the amount  of uranium  entering the kidney  each  day equals 
the amount being removed from the kidney. The daily kidney uptake rate and removal rate 
are calculated from the following formulas:  
 
K = B r x C a x f b x f k 
where  
K = kidney  uptake  rate (mg/day) 
Br = breathing rate (m3/day)  
Ca = air concentration  (mg/m3) 
fb = inhaled  fraction  entering  bloodstream  (0.62)  
fk = bloodstream  fraction  entering kidneys  (0.085)  and DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
23  
  
where  R = λKb  
R = kidney  removal rate (mg/day)  
λ= 0.099 (day‐1) (ICRP,  1997)  
Kb = amount  in the kidney  (mg)  
 
To calculate  the concentration  at which  chronic  exposure  would  result  in a kidney  burden  of 
0.337  mg, the uptake  rate in kidney  is set equal  to the removal rate for a 0.337‐mg  kidney 
burden:  
 
R = (0.337)  x 0.099 = 0.033 mg/day  
 
K = Br (m3/day)  x Ca(mg/m3) x (0.62)  x (0.085) 
K= R = 0.033 mg/day  
Br x Ca x (0.62)  x (0.085)  = 0.033 mg/day  
 
Br x Ca = 0.63  mg/day  
 
Standard  man  breathes  9.6 m3 of air in an 8‐hour  day,  so the resulting concentration  limit  is 
0.63/9.6 = 0.066 mg/m3. This is 30% higher than the OSHA standard for soluble uranium of  
0.050 mg/m3. Consequently,  the OSHA limit  is somewhat  conservative  for exposures  to 
soluble/transportable (i.e., Type F) uranium.  
 
2.4.1 Human Response  Indicators  
 
Most data on human response to uranium exposure comes from accidental exposures 
(generally UF 6 releases). Accidental exposures to UF 6 have resulted in fatalities on at least 
three occasions. The primary cause of injuries and fatalities has been HF that was formed by hydrolysis of UF
6, rather than exposure to UF 6 itself. Several individuals who received high, 
non‐fatal exposures  experienced  pulmonary  edema,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  cramps,  and 
chemical burns on the skin due to HF exposure. In addition, ur inary abnormalities, such as 
transient albuminuria (albumin in urine) and the presence of red cells and casts, were observed, as was retention of nitrogenous products such as urea and non‐protein nitrogen in the blood.  
 
The urinary and blood abnormalities are indicators of kidney damage and are the result of 
inhibited  resorption  in the tubules.  Animal studies  indicate  that urinary  abnormalities  can be 
observed  after  exposures  that are well below  lethal levels.  In addition,  urinary  abnormalities 
such as proteinuria (protein in urine), glucosuria (glucose in urine), and polyuria (increased 
urine volume) have all been observed following uranium exposure, as has the presence of 
certain enzymes in urine. Of all these abnormalities, gluco suria appears to be the most 
sensitive and most nearly proportional to uranium exposure.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
24  
 Once absorbed into the blood, uranium is distributed to bone and kidneys, with a portion of 
the uptake being generally distributed throughout the body. For inhaled uranium, residence 
time  in the lungs  depends  upon  the solubility  of the material.  Material that is deposited  in the 
lungs  is cleared  via the bloodstream,  the pulmonary  lymph,  and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 
Approximately 1 % of the uranium is absorbed into the bloodstream from the GI tract.  
 
In the event of an acute exposure to highly transportable (Class F) uranium compounds, urine 
samples should be collected 3‐4 hours post‐exposure and analyzed for uranium as soon as 
possible. If the uranium concentration is less than 2.0 mg/L, it is unlikely that any significant 
kidney damage has occurred or will occur. However, it  is important to check the urine for 
biological indicators of damage at any exposure above 2.0 mg/L. While the most sensitive 
indicators are increased volume and glucose levels, these are useful only if data on what is 
"normal" for the individual involved are available. Lacking that information, it is best to check 
for albuminuria as an indicator of kidney  damage.  If kidney  damage  is suspected,  a specialist  in 
urinary disorders should be consulted. In general, a urine uranium level greater than 6.0 mg/L 
will produce some level of albuminuria. A level of 20 mg/L indicates a very serious exposure 
with potentially life‐threatening consequences and would indicate  the need for immediate 
hospitalization.  
 
2.4.2 Transfer  to the Fetus  
 
Little information exists on the placental transfer or developmental toxicity of uranium 
isotopes (Sikov et al 1992). The data available with pregnant rats suggest that the effects 
produced  from  exposure  to uranium  may  be due to chemical  toxicity  to the pregnant  animals 
and their embryos/fetuses. Fetoplacental concentrations of uranium peak one day following 
intravenous injection of a pregnant rat. Although concentrations in the placenta decrease 
thereafter, the concentration in the fetal membranes remains relatively constant. Selective 
deposition in some fetal organs will occur when exposure is during the fetal developmental 
stages (NRC, 1992a).  
 
Data from animal experiments suggest that the distribution pattern of uranium is fairly 
uniform, especially at the early stage of gestation. Concentrations of uranium in the 
embryo/fetus are taken to be the same as those in the maternal soft tissues (exclu ding the 
kidney) during the first two months, and they progressively increase thereafter. Following 
transfer into the embryo‐fetus,  uranium  activity  is assumed  to be distributed  uniformly  and to 
remain without excretion.  ICRP Publication 88 (2001) gives do se coefficients for the embryo, 
fetus and newborn of females following intake of selected radionuclides.  It also provides a 
review of biokinetic and dosimetric models for calculating doses to the offspring of mothers 
following intakes by the mother before or during pregnancy.  
 
2.5 Chemical  versus  Radiological  Hazards  
 
Both  the chemical  and radiological  hazards  of uranium  are moderate  compared  to those  of DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
25  
 other industrial materials and radionuclides. Table 2‐4 provides 10 CFR Part 835 derived air 
concentration values for selected radionuclides. Table 2‐8 compares Threshold Limit Values (TLV)  published by ACGIH for  uranium and  selected  other metals. The comparison  of TLVs is 
presented  to provide  perspective on the need  for uranium  workplace  controls,  as compared 
to other hazardous materials. Since these materials affect the body in different ways, this should not be considered a comparison of relative hazards . 
 
The predominant hazard associated with uranium exposure depends upon its degree of enrichment,  its chemical form,  and its physical  form.  The degree  of enrichment  determines 
the gamma radiation intensity and the overall specific activity.

Arsenic  0.01  ‐‐ 
TLV‐TWA  = Threshold Limit  Value,  Time‐Weighted  Average  
TLV‐STEL  = Threshold  Limit  Value,  Short‐term  Exposure  Limit  
 
The relative  activities  of the primary  uranium  isotopes  are also significantly  affected  by the 
degree of enrichment. The total activity is due chiefly to 238U for depleted and 234U for 
enriched uranium, while 235U accounts for little of the total activity, even at very high 
enrichments. 
 
Chemical form determines solubility and consequent transportability in body fluids. ICRP 
Publication  60 (1991a)  classifies  all materials  into three  material types  ‐ F, M, and S. Type  F is 
most transportable (pulmonary removal half‐time of days), Type S the least transportable 
(removal half‐time of years), and Type M an intermediate category (removal half‐time of 
weeks).  The transportability  of an inhaled  or ingested material determines  its fate within  the 
body and, therefore, the resulting radiation dose or chemical effect. Table 2‐9 lists several common uranium compounds and their assigned material types.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

(a) Ammonium  diuranate  is known  to contain  uranium  as UO3  and should  not 
be assigned to a single inhalation class.  
 
(b) The solubility  of uranium  oxides  is very  dependent  on heat  treatment.  The 
rate of oxidation may also affect the solubility. It is recommended that  
solubility  studies  be performed  to characterize  the actual  materials  present.  
 
This listing is intended to  provide  general guidance only, as  a given material’s  transportability 
will depend  upon  a number  of parameters  including its processing history.  It is recommended 
that each facility determine the transportability of materials it handles using one of the 
accepted techniques. Physical form influences potential hazards since non‐dispersible forms generally do not constitute an ingestion or inhalation hazard . 
 
Because inhalation of uranium potentially poses both radiological and chemical hazards, one must determine which hazard is most limiting and whether or not either hazard can be ignored  under  certain  circumstances. When  radiological hazards  are limiting,  chemical hazards 
can generally be neglected, except in overexposure situations. When chemical hazards are limiting, radiological hazards can be neglected only if radiation doses are below regulatory concern. Radiological monitoring is required by DOE for individuals who are likely to receive 
100 millirem  committed  effective dose  (CED)  from  all internal  and external  occupational doses 
received  in a year.  Therefore, it  is prudent to  calculate  organ doses and  CED for  all confirmed 
intakes , since additional exposures in the same year may result in a total dose exceeding the 
mandatory individual monitoring threshold. Even in low‐potential exposure level situations, a  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
27  
 comprehensive  dosimetry/control  program  can prove  invaluable  in possible  future  legal 
litigation.  
 
The limiting hazard (chemical or radiological) depends on the transportability (solubility in 
body fluids), enrichment, and duration of exposure (acute or chronic).  For comparison, the 
more  conservative  of the two chemical  toxicity  standards  (OSHA or ACGIH)  is used  to compare 
the chemical hazard with the radiological hazard. The ICRP Publication 68 (1994b) dose coefficients and ICRP 78 (1997) models are used in the following examples to determine the 
relative hazards for acute and chronic exposure situations.  Table 2‐10 summarizes the dose 
coefficients used in the following examples.

To determine which hazard is limiting for a chronic exposure, the chemical toxicity air 
concentration limit (0.2 mg/m3 for material type “S” and 0.05 mg/m3 for material types “F” 
and “M”) and a calculated derived air concentration (DAC), based on percent enrichment, are 
used.  For material type “F” the DAC is based on 50 rems to the bone surface, for material 
type “M” the DAC is based on 5 rems effective dose, and for material type “S” the DAC is based on 50 rems to extrathoracic portion of the respiratory tract. The dose coefficients from Table 2‐10 are used to calculate a DAC for varying enrichments. The enrichment at which the DAC is equal to the chemical toxicity limit forms the "dividing line" between chemical and 
radiological limits as the limiting hazard. Generally, exposures to higher enrichments are 
limited by radiological limits; exposures to lower enrichments by chemical limits. Example 3a provides the methodology for determining the "dividing line" enrichment for the chronic 
exposure  scenario.  The same  calculation  is done  using the 100 millirem  monitoring threshold.  
 
For an acute  exposure  scenario,  the amount  of an intake which  would  result  in exceeding the 
fifteen minute time weighted chemical toxicity short term exposure limit for material types “F”, “M”, and “S” uranium (i.e., 0.6 mg/m
3 x 0.3 m3 air intake per fifteen minute s) is DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
28  
 235 determined.  This amount is compared to the amount of an intake which would result in 
exceeding the radiological limit.  Again, for material type “F” the radiological limit is based on 
50 rems  to the bone  surface,  for material  type  “M” the radiological  limit  is based  on 5 rems  to 
the whole body, and for material type “S” the radiological limit is based on 50 rems to 
extrathoracic  portion  of the respiratory  tract.  Example  3b provides  the methodology  used  for 
an acute exposure scenario. Table 2‐11 summarizes the “dividing line” enrichments, above which radiological limits are controlling. The same calculation is done using the 100 millirem 
monitoring threshold.  
 
Example  3a ‐ General  Solution,  Chronic  Exposure  
 
Step  1. For increasing  
235U enrichments,  and consequential  234U enrichment,  determine  the 
activity fraction (AF) from 234U, 235U, and 238U in the enriched uranium.  
 
 
AF234 
 
AF235 
AF238 =  Enrichment 234 * SA 234  
Enrichment 234 * SA 234 + Enrichment 235 * SA 235 + Enrichment 238 * SA 238 
 
=  Enrichment 235 * SA 235  
Enrichment 234 * SA 234 + Enrichment 235 * SA 235 + Enrichment 238 * SA 238 
=  Enrichment 238 * SA 238  
Enrichment 234 * SA 234 + Enrichment 235 * SA 235 + Enrichment 238 * SA 238 
 
Where:  
Enrichment  is the percent  by weight.  
SA234 = specific  activity  of 234U = 2.30E+08 Bq/g 
SA235 = specific activity of 235U = 79312 Bq/g 
SA238 = specific activity of 238U = 12329 Bq/g  
 
Enrichment 234 ≅  (0.0055 natural  fraction  234U) * 235U enrichment  * 1.2(a) 
(0.72 natural  fraction  U 
 
(a) Gaseous diffusion enrichment of 235U results a proportionally greater enrichment of 
234U. The 1.2 factor takes  into account  the gaseous  diffusion  process  causing a greater 
increase in 234U than in 235U (See Section 2.1.3).  
 
Enrichment 238 = 100  - Enrichment 234 - Enrichment 235 
 
Step  2. Using the dose  coefficients  from  Table  2‐10 and the activity fractions,  for increasing 
enrichments,  determine  activity  enriched  uranium  organ  and effective  dose  coefficients  for 
material types “F”, “M” and “S”.  
 
% Enrichment  Dose  Coeff  
= AF 234 ∗ dose  coeff 234 + AF 235 ∗ dose  coeff 235 + AF 238 
* dose  coeff 238 
 
For example,  for 5% enriched  uranium  (i.e.,  5%, by weight,  of the uranium  is235U), material 
type “S” dose to the extrathoracic portion of the respiratory tract:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
29  
 Using the equations  from  Step  1, it is determined  that,  for 5% enriched uranium, 
87% of the activity is from 234U, 3% from 235U, and 10% from  238U. 
 
From  this we can determine  a dose  coefficient  for 5% enriched uranium  using the 
above equation:  
 
5% Enrichment  Dose  Coeff  = 0.87  * 7.5E  - 5 Sv/Bq + 0.03  * 6.9E  - 05 Sv/Bq + 
0.1 * 6.5E - 5 Sv/Bq = 7.38E  - 5 Sv/Bq 
 
Step 3. The ALI is determined, for different enrichments using the % enrichment dose 
coefficient  determined  in Step  2. For material type  “F” the % enrichment  ALI is based  on 50 
rems  to the bone  surface,  for material type  “M”  it is based  on 5 rems  effective  dose,  and for 
material type “S” on 50 rems to extrathoracic portion of the respiratory tract.  
 
 
% Enrichment  ALI = Dose  Limit  
 
 
% Enrichment  dose coeff  
 
The % enrichment ALI, which is units of Bq, is converted to a mass using the SA % enrichment  formula and is divided by the volume  of air a worker  breathes  in a work  year 
(2000 hours), 2400 m
3, to give a mass airborne concentration value.  
 
SA % Enrichment  = [(0.4 + 0.38 (enrichment ) + 0.0034 (enrichment )2] * 1.0E  - 6; 
 
Where enrichment  is the fraction  by weight  of 235U, expressed  as a percentage. 
Note  that the value  of SA % Enriched  as calculated  by the formula is in units  of µCi/g 
(Equation from 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix B, footnote 3)  
 
 
Air Concentration  (g/m3) = (% Enrichment  ALI) 
 
 
SA %Enrichment  * Air Volume  Intake  
 
The mass  airborne  concentration  value  is used  for comparison  with  the chemical  toxicity 
limit. 
 
Continuing the above  example:  the ALI for 5% enriched  uranium,  material type  “S” dose  to 
the extrathoracic portion of the respiratory tract:  
 
 
% Enrichment  ALI = 0.5 Sv 
 
 
7.38E  - 5 Sv/Bq 1 μCi 
∗ 37000  Bq  
= 0.18 μCi 
 
SA 5% Enrichment  = (0.4 + 0.38  * 5 + 0.0034  * 52) * 1.0E  - 6 = 2.38E  - 6 μCi/g  
 
 
Air Concentration =  0.18 μCi 
2.38E  - 6 μCi/g * 2400 m3 * 1000  mg = 0.032  mg/m3 
1 g DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
30  
  
 
 
Example  3b ‐ General  Solution,  Acute  Exposure 
Steps 1 and 2: Same as in example 3a.  
Step  3. This is similar to Step  3 in example 3a, with  the exception that % enrichment  ALI is 
not divided by the volume of air a worker breathes in a work year, 2400 m3. 
 
The annual limit on intake (ALI) is determined, for different enrichments using the % 
enrichment  dose  coefficient  determined  in Step  2. For material type  “F” the % enrichment 
ALI is based  on 50 rems  to the  bone  surface,  for material type  “M”, it  is based  on 5 rems to 
the whole body, and for material type “S”, on 50 rems to extrathoracic portion of the respiratory  tract.  The resultant  value,  in Bq, is converted  to a mass  using the SA % enriched 
formula. The result is a mass intake limit.  
 
 
% Enrichment  ALI = Dose  Limit  
 
 
% Enrichment  dose coeff  
Mass  Intake  Limit  = % Enrichment  ALI 
SA % Enrichment  
From  example  3a: the ALI for 5% enriched uranium,  material type  “S” dose  to the 
extrathoracic portion of the respiratory tract:  
 
 
% Enrichment  ALI = 0.5 Sv 
 
 
7.38E  - 5 Sv/Bq 1 μCi 
* 37000  Bq  
= 0.18 μCi 
 
Mass  Intake  Limit  = 0.18 μCi * 1000  mg = 75.8  mg 
2.38E  - 6 μCi/g 1 g 
 
Step 4. This value is compared to the product of the volume breathed in fifteen minutes times  the short
‐t
erm exposure  limit  for chemical  toxicity  (0.6 mg/m3 (OSHA STEL) * 0.3 m3 Step 4. This value is compared to the chronic chemical toxicity air concentration limit (0.2 
mg/m3 (ACGIH TLV) for material type “S” and 0.05 mg/m3 (OSHA soluble PEL) for material 
types “F” and “M”.  As the enrichment increases the air concentration values determined  
for radiological control decrease.  The enrichment where they fall below the chemical 
toxicity  limits  becomes  the “dividing line”  where  radiological limits  become  more  restrictive.  
 
In the above  example  the air concentration  value,  0.032  mg/m3, is lower than  the chemical 
toxicity  value  and is therefore limiting  (for type  “S” material,  chronic  exposure,  radiological 
considerations are limiting for all enrichments).  
 
Step  5. The above  process  is repeated  using the 100 millirem  monitoring  threshold  in lieu of 
the annual dose limit.  For these calculations the effective dose coefficients are used for all 
isotopes.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
31

Limits Predominate (Calculations Not Shown)

S (a) 41.8%  (b) (b) 
(a) Chemical  toxicity  limits  are limiting  at all enrichments.  
(b) Radiological limits  are limiting  at all enrichments.  
 
As shown  in Table  2‐11,  for chronic  exposures,  the 100 millirem monitoring threshold (i.e., 2% 
of radiological limit) results in radiological conditions, requiring evaluation of the need to 
monitor radiological intakes, as a controlling factor.  For chronic exposures the radiological 
dose  limits  are controlling  for type  “S” material for all enrichments,  and for lower enrichments 
for types “M” and “F” material.  For acute exposure situations, the radiological monitoring 
threshold  is a controlling  factor  for higher  enrichments  for types “M” and “S” material.  For all 
other acute exposure situations, the chemical toxicity limits, which are based on a fifteen 
minute or less exposure, are more controlling than the radiological limits, which are based on 
an annual exposure.  
 
2.6 Natural  Uranium  Balance  in Man 
 
Uranium is present in trace quantities throughout the environment. As a result, man ingests about  2 µg of natural  uranium  each  day in food  and fluids.  A similar quantity  is excreted  each 
day in the feces and urine. The uranium balance for  reference  man  is presented in Table 5‐8.  breathed per fifteen minutes = 0.16 mg for material types “F”, “M”, and “S”.  As the 
enrichment increases the mass acute intake limit determined for radiological control 
decreases.  The enrichment  where  they  fall below  the chemical toxicity  limits  becomes  the 
“dividing line” where, for an acute exposure, radiological limits become more restrictive.  
 
In the above example the mass acute intake limit, 75.8 mg, is higher than the chemical toxicity  value  and therefore the chemical toxicity  limit  is controlling  for this enrichment  (for 
acute exposures, compared to the radiological limit, chemical toxicity considerations are always limiting).  
 
Step  5. The above  process  is repeated  using the 100 millirem  monitoring  threshold  in lieu of 
the annual dose limit.  For these calculations the effective dose coefficients are used for all 
isotopes.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
32  
  
Table  2‐13.  Uranium  Balance  for Reference Man(a) 
 
Intake:  
Food  and fluids:  1.9 µg/day  
Inhalation:  7.0 E‐3  µg/day  
Losses:  
Feces:  1.4 ‐ 1.8 µg/day  
Urine:  0.05 ‐ 0.5 µg/day  
Other  (hair)  0.02 µg/day  
(a) ICRP  Publication  23 (1975)  
 
The range  of intake  and losses  has been  observed  to vary  over  several orders  of magnitude, 
depending upon the uranium concentration in foods and in the water supply.  
 
2.7 Industrial  Hazards  
 
The principal industrial hazards associated with uranium are fires, hydrogen generation, 
generation of oxides of nitrogen, and associated mechanical hazards characteristic of heavy 
objects, e.g., back injuries from lifting, dropping heavy parts on feet. Hy drogen fluoride (HF) 
and oxides of nitrogen (NO x) are by‐products or reactants of common chemical processes. 
Hydrogen (H 2) can be generated by reaction of water with uranium metal, and finely divided 
uranium  or uranium  chips  with  a large  surface  area to volume  ratio  can ignite  spontaneously.  
 
2.7.1 Hydrogen  Fluoride  
 
Hydrogen fluoride is an extremely corrosive acid that is relatively volatile in its anhydrous form. Anhydrous HF is a  reactant for the production of UF
4 from UO 3, a by‐product of the 
production of UF 4 from UF 6, and is generated whenever UF 6 is released to the atmosphere 
(H20 in air + UF 6 → UO 2F2 and HF). External contact with HF results in chemical burns of the 
skin, while exposure to airborne HF causes chemical burns/irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. Significant inhalation can result in pulmonary edema. Chronic exposure to excessive 
fluoride concentrations results in increased radiographic bone density and may ev entually 
cause fluorosis (osteosclerosis). In general, individuals can smell HF at levels of 0.02‐0.2 
mg/m
3, much lower than the TLV of 2.5 mg/m3. The TLV was set based primarily on the 
irritation of eyes and mucous passages rather than on permanent damage. Because an airborne concentration of 10 mg/m
3 is intolerable, personnel exposed to such levels will 
evacuate the area  if they  are able  to do so. Exposure for  as little  as 15 minutes  to an airborne 
concentration of 20‐30 mg/m3 may prove fatal (pulmonary edema). The AIHA Emergency 
Response Planning Guides (ERPGs) for HF are as follows: ERPG‐3, 42 mg/m3; ERPG‐2, 17 
mg/m3; and ERPG‐1, 4 mg/m3. The NIOSH IDLH value is 25 mg/m3. DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
33  
 2.7.2 Nitric  Compounds  
 
Nitric acid is widely used for digesting uranium metal and uranium‐bearing compounds and 
for "pickling"  metal  products  to inhibit  oxidation.  Concentrated  nitric  acid gives  off fumes  that 
cause irritation to eyes, mucous membranes, and skin. Significant inhalation can result in 
pulmonary edema. The ACGIH TLV‐TWA and TLV‐STEL values for nitric acid are 2 ppm and 4 
ppm, respectively.  
 
When uranium materials, especially metal, are dissolved in nitric acid, oxides of nitrogen (NO 
x) are generated.  The term  NO x is applied  to mixtures  of nitric  oxide  (NO) and nitrogen  dioxide 
(NO 2). The ACGIH TLV‐TWA and STEL are 25 ppm and 3 ppm, respectively. Exposure to NO 2 
can cause eye irritation, coughing, mucoid frothy sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, 
pulmonary edema, cyanosis, tachypnea (abnormal rapid breathing), and tachycardia 
(abnormal rapid heartbeat).  
 
2.7.3 Hydrogen  Gas 
 
Hydrogen gas (H 2) is used as a reactant  in the production of UF 4 from UF 6 and in the reduction 
of UO 3 to UO 2, an intermediate step in the production of UF 4 from UO 3. The H 2 is usually 
generated by dissociating ammonia, so associated ammonia rather than hydrogen is 
frequently identified as the reactant in those processes. Any facility where H 2 is used as a 
reactant  should  include  design  features  (e.g.,  H2 monitors,  roof  vents)  to ensure  that hydrogen 
accumulations do not occur. Generally, H 2 hazards and cont rol features are identified in  
facility  Documented  Safety  Analyses.  Hydrogen can also be generated  when  moisture  contacts 
uranium metal, especially finely divided uranium metal such as machining chips. Care must be 
taken to ensure that H 2 generated in this manner does not accumulate (in closed drums or 
storage containers for example).  
 
2.7.4 Fire 
 
Finely divided uranium metal is highly reactive or pyrophoric, capable of igniting 
spontaneously.  This type  of material  should  be handled  and stored  in a manner  that minimizes 
fire potential. Typically, machining chips are stored under water or machining oil in open 
storage containers so that any H 2 generated does not accumulate. Neither water spray, CO 2, 
nor halon extinguishers are effective in fighting uranium fires. In fact, halon may be explosive  
if directed at burning uranium and can produce very toxic fumes and gases. Small uranium fires can be smothered in MET‐L‐X powder (a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium 
carbonate).  Larger fires,  involving  drums  of machining turnings,  for example,  can be controlled 
by immersing  the burning container  in water.  Even  this will not immediately  extinguish  the fire 
because the hot uranium metal dissociates the water into H
2 and O 2, providing fuel and  
oxygen for the fire. If the quantity of water is sufficient, eventually the water will provide 
enough cooling to extinguish the fire, but a significant amount of water can boil away in the 
process. If the water level is allowed to fall low enough to uncove r the uranium while the fire  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
34  
 is still burning,  it will resume  burning visibly.  DOE‐HDBK‐1081‐2014,  Primer  on Spontaneous 
Heating and Pyrophoricity (2014b), contains additional guidance.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
35  
 3 RADIATION  PROTECTION  
An effective radiation protection program at a uranium facility requires scrupulous attention 
to controlling both internal and external doses. The radiation protection program should 
ensure the detection and quantification of all types of radiation (i.e., alpha, beta, neutron, 
gamma, and x‐ray) over wide energy ranges. The radiation detection instruments should be 
properly calibrated and routinely checked. Emphasis should be on establishing controls for 
internal and external radiation exposure using ALARA g uidelines. Prompt and accurate 
assessment  is important  in determining each  individual’s  dose  and in establishing  an accurate 
historical record. This section defines the basis for establishing a comprehensive radiation 
protection program.  
 
3.1 Regulations  and Standards  
 
DOE  has established  occupational radiation  protection  regulations  in 10 CFR Part 835.  DOE  has 
provided supporting and clarifying guidance in the DOE G 441.1‐1C  Chg 1 (Admin Chg) 
(2011a ), DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b), and DOE Radiological Control Technical Positions. 
Other related source documents include publications of the EPA, NRC, ANSI, ICRP, NCRP, and 
UNSCEAR. Individual states may also have their own radiological control regulations, with 
equivalent or more res trictive requirements than the Federal regula tions.  
 
3.2 Radiation Protection  Programs 
 
An effective radiation protection program consists of a group of related and integrated 
functional  elements.  The documentation  that describes  the DOE  activity’s  program  to control 
occupational radiation protection is referred to as the documented radiation protection 
program (RPP). Although the actual titles and contents of the functional elements are left to 
the discretion of DOE’s operating entities, DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) 
suggests the following, based on the content of 10 CFR Part 835:  
 
a. Organization  and Administration  
b. ALARA  Program  
c. External  Dosimetry  Program  
d. Internal  Dosimetry  Program  
e. Area  Monitoring  and Control  
f. Radiological Controls  
g. Emergency  Exposure  Situations  
h. Nuclear  Accident  Dosimetry  
i. Records  
j. Reports  to Individuals  
k. Radiation  Safety  Training  
l. Limits  for the Embryo/Fetus  
 
Each  of these functional  elements  is discussed  in more  detail below.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
36  
 3.2.1 Organization and Administration  
 
This functional  element addresses  the overall administration  of the program,  including the 
documented RPP itself, various organizational and institutional issues, and program 
assessment. DOE G441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) 
provide detailed guidance on implementing these requirements.  
 
Although 10 CFR § 835.101 requires that DOE activities be conducted in compliance with a 
documented RPP, the rule does not establish specific requirements for RPP format and 
content. Due to the wide range of activities undertaken by and for DOE, there is significant 
flexibility in these provisions. Cognizant DOE line management determines the acceptable 
format and content of the documented RPP. However, the documented RPP shall address 
each  requirement  of 10 CFR Part 835 and shall be approved  by DOE  (10 CFR § 835.101).  Any 
changes that decrease the effectiveness of the RPP shall be approved by DOE before implementation (10 CFR 
§ 835.101).  
 
Internal  audits  of the RPP,  including examination  of program  content  and implementation, 
shall be conducted  through  a process  that ensures  all functional  elements  are reviewed  no 
less frequently than every 36 months (10 CFR § 835.102). An effective quality assurance 
program  for radiation  protection  should  include  establishment  of appropriate  standards  of 
performance for essential activities and equipment, with an effective system of 
documentation  and traceability  of those  activities  and of the use of the equipment.  Proper 
maintenance of those records will be necessary for reference purposes. Additional 
requirements and guidance are pro vided in 10 CFR Part 830, Nuclear Safety Management 
(2020c ), DOE O 414.1D  Chg 2 , Quality Assurance ( 2020d ), and their associated guides. 
Specific guidance applicable to RPPs is provided in DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (2011 a). 
 
3.2.1.1  Administrative  Controls  
 
In any facility that handles radioactive materials, the major controls protecting workers, the 
public, and the environment are physical design features, such as structures and installed equipment, which shield, contain, and confine the radioactive materials. However, to allow 
useful work to be performed in the facility and to ensure that its protective features remain 
effective, a number of administrative controls are ordinarily required. These controls are 
usually described in and implemented through a ser ies of policy statements and procedures 
related to the operations and maintenance activities to be carried out in the facility. All personnel who work in controlled areas should be familiar with the administrative controls that apply  to their  work.  Changes  or additions  to administrative  controls  should  be effectively 
communicated to all persons who may be affected.  
 
Radiation Protection  Procedures  
 
A uranium  facility  should  have  a written  policy  on radiation  protection,  including formal plans  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
37  
 and measures  for applying the as low as reasonably  achievable  (ALARA)  process  to 
occupational exposure (10 CFR § 835.101(c)).  
 
To ensure facility activities are executed safely and in a manner that consistently meets 
management expectations, documented procedures should provide detailed instructions for 
implementing various  functional  elements  of the RPP.  Written  procedures  shall be developed 
and implemented as necessary to ensure compliance with 10 CFR Part 835, commensurate 
with the radiological hazards created by the activity and consistent with the education, 
training, and skills of the individuals exposed to those hazards (10 CFR § 835.104).  
Responsibilities and actions required of management and workers should be clearly and 
unambiguously stated. It is not necessary for written procedures to be developed and 
implemented  for all of the requirements  of 10 CFR Part 835.  Written  procedures  should  be 
developed and employed under the following circumstances:  
 
a. When  worker  health  and safety  are directly  affected  
 
b. When  the expected  outcome  for the process  or operation  requires  that a specific 
method be followed  
 
c. When  the process  or operation  is infrequently  used  and competence  training  cannot 
assure adequate implementation  
 
d. To document  the approved  method  to implement  specific  processes or operations  
 
In evaluating the need for written procedures, consideration should be given to the level and 
extent of the radiological hazards, the complexity of the measures required to achieve compliance, and the education, training and skills of the individuals who must implement 
those  measures.  Under  such  a regimen, a  low hazard  activity  employing a stable  staff of highly 
educated and skilled workers having demonstrated an advanced knowledge of radiation 
protection principles and practices could have fewer and less detailed procedures than a 
higher hazard activity employing a transient workforce with less knowledge of radiation 
protection practices and principles. DOE G 441.1‐1C provides additional guidance regarding 
specific procedural aspects of the RPP.  
 
All radiation protection procedures and controls should have formal, recognizable technical 
bases for limits, methods, and personnel protection standards. Procedures should be 
adequately  documented,  updated  periodically,  and maintained  in a centralized  historical file. 
A control system should be established to account for all copies and ensure all new procedures are included in the historical files. A designated period of time for maintaining 
historical files should be established. ANSI/HPS N13.6‐2010, Prac tice for Occupational 
Radiation Exposure  Records  Systems  (2010)  provides guidance  on maintaining  historical  files. 
In addition,  radiation  protection  procedures  should  have  a documented  approval system  and 
established intervals for review and/or revision. A tracking system should be developed to  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
38  
 ensure  that the required  reviews  and revisions  occur.  
 
Management  Commitment  
 
Management commitment to safety is the most important characteristic of an effective 
radiological control program. If the management commitment to safety is strong, the 
radiological control program will be valued and respected. The radiological control program should  be provided  adequate  authority  to permit  performance  of necessary  assignments  and 
program implementation. Management commitment to the ALARA concept is particularly 
important (see Article 111 of the DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b)). Adequate personnel, 
equipment, and funding should be available as a part of this commitment.  
 
Radiological  Control  Organization 
 
The radiological control  organization  should  be structured  so that all of the activities  required 
to provide support to line management and workers can be accomplished.  
 
Radiological  Control  Organization  Independence  and Reporting  Level  
 
The radiological control organization should be independent of the line organization 
responsible for production, operation, or research activities and should have an equivalent 
reporting level. Because radiological control personnel should have the authority to balance 
operations with safety, they should not report directly to the administrators of operations. 
When shift work is involved, the operations shift supervisor may make minor radiological 
control decisions in support of the shift’s Radiological Control Technicians (RCTs); however, 
decisions  involving  basic  policies  and procedures  should  be directed  to a separate  radiological 
control organization.  
 
If a safety organization includes the radiological control program, it must be high enough in 
the company  to allow  direct  access  to the company  president  or equivalent.  If the radiological 
control program is administered by a separate radiological control organization, that 
organization  must  also be in a position  to have  direct access  to the company  president. This is 
to safeguard the program from the pressures of production that exist in the operational 
environment and to keep it independent of operating organizations.  
 
A system  of guides,  policies,  and procedures  should  be established  to clearly  identify  the inter‐ 
relationships, responsibilities, and authorities of those involved with the development, operation, and maintenance of the facility and the health and safety of the employees. These 
guides, policies, and procedures should be documented and reviewed at least once every  
year.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
39  
 Adequacy  of Personnel  and Equipment  
 
A sufficient number of  qualified and, where  required, certified  radiological control  personnel 
must be available to perform necessary tasks for support of uranium facility startup and 
operation. Sufficient equipment, including protective clothing, respiratory protective 
equipment,  and radiation  detection  instrumentation  should  be available  to support  RCTs  and 
operating personnel in the performance of work in controlled areas.  
 
Staffing  and Staff  Qualifications  
 
A cadre of operating and maintenance personnel who have experience in the operation of a 
uranium  facility  should  be established  during the construction  of a new  facility.  The remainder 
of the operating and maintenance  staff  should  be hired  as soon  as possible  and should  receive 
formal and informal training  from  the experienced  personnel.  This step  is extremely  important 
to enable all personnel to grow with the facility and learn the details of the operations. Once 
operations start, potential problems already should have been identified, and engineering or 
administrative changes should have been made to resolve t hem.  
 
Staffing  in the radiological control  organization  requires  technicians  and professionals  in many 
support areas. A successful radiological control program is highly dependent upon the 
availability of adequate staff support in disciplines such as environmental monitoring, 
instrument  maintenance  and calibration,  internal and external  dosimetry,  meteorology,  safety 
analysis, and risk management.  
 
Radiological  Control  Technician Training  
 
A thorough  RCT training  program  should  be established  at uranium  facilities.  Before  uranium 
operations begin, a trained and qualified staff of RCTs should be present. All RCT training 
should  be accomplished  in accordance  with  the DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017  (2017 b) and DOE‐HDBK‐
1122‐2009, Radiological Control Technician Training Program ( 2011b ). 
 
Professional  Staffing  and Qualifications  
 
The senior staff of the radiological control organization should include health physicists and other professionals with four‐year degrees in science or engineering. A continuing training 
program  should  be established  for facility  personnel.  Pursuit  of certification  by the American 
Board  of Health  Physics for  senior  and professional staff members should  be encouraged.  At 
least one professional staff member at the uranium facility should have a minimum of three years of radiological control experience in the operation of uranium fac ilities.  
 
Technician Staffing  and Qualifications  
 
Recommendations  for minimum  entry‐level  requirements  for RCTs  are given  in DOE‐STD‐  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
40  
 1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) and the Radiological  Control  Technician  Training  Program.  They  include  a 
high school education or equivalency and knowledge of certain scientific fundamentals. If a 
two‐year degree in nuclear technology or an equivalent discipline is locally available, 
completion of such a program should be encouraged.  
 
Where possible, the RCTs and other members of the radiological control staff should have a 
minimum of one year’s experience working at a uranium facility. Such experience is an 
important prerequisite to allow them to work unsupervised. Personnel hired with out such 
experience should  work  an internship  of six months  under  the leadership  of a qualified  RCT or 
supervisor with experience in that facility. RCTs should be encouraged to pursue registration by the National Registry of Radiation Protection Technologists.  
 
Training  Staff  Qualifications  
 
All training instructors and materials should meet the requirements of DOE Order 426.2, 
Personnel Selection, Training, Qualification, and Certification Requirements for DOE Nuclear 
Facilities (2013). DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) provides additional guidance. Each uranium 
facility should develop performance‐based training that reflects radiological conditions 
present  at the facility.  This training  should  be monitored  to ensure  that site‐specific,  worker‐ 
performance‐based measures, and practical factors are inc luded in the uranium training.  
 
Health Physicist  Training  Involvement  
 
Facility health physicists should have comprehensive knowledge of all of the material on 
uranium  radiation  safety  included  in the training  programs  for radiation  workers  and RCTs.  In 
addition to the previously discussed RCT training material, DOE has developed several other radiation safety training courses and qualification standards which may provide useful 
information. This include s DOE‐HDBK‐1130‐2022,  Radiological  Worker  Training (2022d) .
 
 
Staffing  Levels  
 
At least  one professional  health  physicist  is recommended  to be on the staff of each  major 
uranium facility as a full‐time employee.  
 
There is no rule of thumb  for determining the number  of RCTs  needed  for a given  uranium 
facility.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
41  
  
The number of RCTs should be based on an analysis that provides for sufficient coverage on 
each  shift,  given the number  of samples, surveys,  and other  work  to be performed,  the time  of 
training, donning and doffing of protective clothing, shift turnover procedures, and other similar considerations. The dose rate and individual dose limits in the facility may also lead to 
the need for additional personnel.  Consideration  should  be given to having sufficient  numbers 
of personnel to respond to off‐normal conditions and emergencies as well as routine work.  
Major maintenance,  modifications,  or decommissioning activities  may  require  additional 
personnel.  
 
3.2.2 ALARA  Program  
 
The policy  for maintaining  radiation  exposures  ALARA  has existed  in principle  since  the early 
1940s. The evolution of ALARA into a formal program began in the early 1960s.  
 
Although there is, and has been since the 1940s, a series of official established dose limits, 
they do not represent ALARA. ALARA is a continuous process of controlling and managing 
radiation exposure to workers, the general public, and the environment. Al though ALARA is 
based upon protection of people and the environment, the philosophy is also grounded on sound economic and operating principles. The responsibility for maintaining radiation exposures ALARA is not a unique responsibility of management or radiological control 
personnel. It is a responsibility of everyone involved in managing, supervising, or performing 
radiation  work.  It is imperative  to teach  administrative  personnel  to support  the principles  and 
practice of ALARA, and to train all workers to consider ALARA as they prepare for and perform 
their work.  
 
3.2.2.1  Assignment  of ALARA  Responsibility  and Authority  
 
Limiting  radiation  exposures  to the lowest  levels commensurate  with  economics  and the work 
to be accomplished has long been a part of radiological control and radiological protection 
programs of DOE and its contractors. 10 CFR Part 835 and DOE O 458.1 establish the policy of 
maintaining doses ALARA for workers and the public, respectively, resulting from radiation 
from  DOE  operations.  10 CFR § 835.101(c)  requires  that plans  and programs  implementing the 
ALARA process be prepared, and 10 CFR § 835.704(b) req uires that records must be 
maintained to demonstrate the implementation of ALARA. DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011a ) and DOE‐ STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017b ) provide additional guidance.  
 
An ALARA committee should be established at the uranium facility. The membership should 
include managers and workers from the line, the technical support organization, and the 
radiological control organization. A line manager, such as a Director of Operations, Research, 
or Maintenance, should serve as the commi ttee chair. The ALARA committee should make 
recommendations  to management to improve  progress  toward  minimizing  radiation  exposure 
and radiological releases.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
42  
  
3.2.2.2  Current  Status  of ALARA  Programs  
 
Currently,  it is common  practice  in DOE  facilities  to have  a well‐structured  ALARA  plan  for the 
entire facility, with more detailed plans in the various buildings or functional subunits of the 
facility. There is ordinarily a facility coordinator who administers the overall ALARA plan and reports to top‐level management of the facility. Coordinato rs for the various buildings or 
subunits of the facility receive guidance from the overall facility coordinator and report the results of their ALARA programs to th at individual.  
 
3.2.2.3  Achievement  of Goals  
 
To ensure improving radiological performance, at the beginning of each year, each facility 
should prepare radiological performance goals. At intervals commensurate with the radiological  risk, the contractor  should  provide  DOE  with  an interim  status  report  of the goals. 
At the end of the calendar year, the contractor should provide DOE an Annual Goal Status Report.  
 
Identifying specific ALARA goals in uranium facilities requires close coordination between the 
facility ALARA team members (operations, maintenance, and radiological control personnel) 
made up from a cross‐section of personnel representing the various work  elements of the 
facility.  ALARA  goals  may  be formulated  as qualitative  or quantitative  types  of goals,  but must 
be measurable and achievable, with clearly defined endpoints.  
 
3.2.2.4  Quality  Assurance  
 
Important aspects of any ALARA program are the measurement of beneficial effects and the 
determination that important factors, such as economic impacts, the time involved in 
accomplishing tasks, and the utilization of personnel, are being optimized. To accomplish 
these  objectives,  it is necessary  to have  a written  plan  for the ALARA  program  and high ‐quality 
records of activities involving exposures to workers, the public, and the environment. These 
permit comparisons with past experiences and analysis of the recorded activities. In many 
cases, such studies of the recorded activities not only confirm satisfactory execution of the 
work, but reveal opportunities for future improvements.  
 
One approach that works well is the inclusion of an ALARA worksheet with the RWP. Such a 
worksheet should be prepared by an individual with responsibilities for the work to be 
performed, a relatively detailed knowledge of the radiological conditions, and k nowledge of 
what  is required  to accomplish  the task.  The worksheet  should  contain  estimates  of the time 
to complete the task and the expected radiation doses to be received. If any specially‐ 
engineered devices are used to control personnel exposure, they should be noted on the 
ALARA worksheet, with any special instructions they require. These worksheets provide 
valuable information for analysis of the effectiveness of the ALARA program for each job.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
43  
  
3.2.2.5  Technical  Aspects  
 
The technical aspects of ALARA programs include not only the standard equipment regularly 
used  in controlling  dose  to workers,  the public,  and the environment,  such  as facility  shielding, 
ventilation filters, installed and portable radiation measuring instruments, but also many 
special devices  that may  be used  temporarily.  Special devices  can be used  to provide  exposure 
control and/or containment when it may not be practical without them. These include 
temporary shields, tents or greenhouses, portable HEPA exhaust fans, ductwork and filters, 
and special fixtures to hold highly radioactive materials requiring detailed inspection, repair, 
modification, or fabrication. Such devices can reduce radiation exposures by controlling 
contamination, which might not be possible otherwise.  
 
Some  of these  special devices  may  have  general application  and be kept  on hand  for use as 
needed. In some cases, devices would have to be specially fabricated for a specific task.  
Because  this would  ordinarily  have  a significant  effect  on the cost of doing  that job, the 
economic aspects of doing or not doing the job should be carefully evaluated.  
 
3.2.2.6  Attributes  of Effective  Review and Audit  
 
Evaluation of the effectiveness of an ALARA program requires both reviews and auditing. The reviews will include detailed examination of the written ALARA program plan and the records 
of ALARA activities. The objectives in such reviews are to find if the written plan is being followed,  and what  is working  or not working  well.  Such  reviews  can be performed  adequately 
by either a knowledgeable member of the facility staff or an equally knowledgeable outsider. 
The written  report of a review should be directed to a member of management who is 
responsible for implementation of the ALARA program.  
 
Audits are best performed by an outside expert who is knowledgeable about work with 
uranium and its radiological characteristics so that the auditor can look for problems and 
make appropriate evaluations and recommendations. The auditor should not only exa mine 
the ALARA  program  plan  and records,  but should  also visit the working  areas  and laboratories 
in the facility with a knowledgeable escort who can answer questions about activities and conditions in the facility.  
 
Reviews  and/or  audits provide  the means to  evaluate  the effectiveness  of the ALARA program 
through a detailed analysis of the data. Through these analyses, specific opportunities for improvement may  be identified. For example,  the exposure  experience  of a specific  group  can 
be tracked to evaluate trends and their probable causes. An increasing exposure trend can 
signal degradation  in the radiological  control  program,  a need  for specialized  training,  changes 
in the work force, or a change in equipment or operational procedure in the areas in which 
higher exposures are being experienced. Similarly, a decreasing exposure trend could mean 
either that the ALARA program is accomplishing its objective or that a major change in  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
44  
 radiological work  has occurred.  Such  trends  should  be examined  at least  quarterly  to permit 
initiation of timely corrective actions.  
 
When  exposure  trends  and probable  causes  are clearly  understood,  the information  should  be 
provided to both management and staff. If an increasing exposure trend is identified, it can 
call attention to the problem allowing corrective action to be taken or to signal special 
procedures or precautions that may be needed. When the ALARA program i s successful in 
reducing exposures, immediate feedback can verify program effectiveness and encourage 
further support of the program.  
 
Reviews and/or audits and communication of the results provide the base for program 
upgrade.  Audits  and/or  reviews  are also an effective  means  to evaluate  the effectiveness  of a 
policy or procedure change and assist in determining what changes are most effective for a 
given set of conditions,  provide  a basis  for future  decisions  as to effective means  for reducing 
exposure, provide a basis for comparing costs with results, and provide a measure of the 
program’s effectiveness for controlling individual and person‐rem exposures as well as dose 
ranges and percentage of total person‐rem represented by the ranges.  
 
3.2.2.7  ALARA  at Uranium  Processing  Facilities  
 
The ALARA concept has wide application and serves as a basis for sound radiological control 
programs. The fundamental ALARA objective is to reduce radiation doses to the lowest 
practical levels commensurate with sound economics and operating practices. Realistic 
numerical goals  can be set and achieved;  however,  compliance  with  numerical  standards  does 
not provide evidence that the ALARA concept is fully incorporated in the radiological control 
program. Rather, the success of a mature ALARA program is measured by many factors 
including intangibles, s uch as dedication to the concept of dose control. A set of ALARA 
recommendations will therefore include both numerical goals and some relatively general 
philosophical guidance that, by itself, may not appear to assist in achieving ALARA goals.  
 
Development and implementation of an ALARA program in many uranium facilities may be a 
challenging task, due primarily to the fact that penetrating radiation doses are typically low 
and few individuals are exposed near the regulatory limits for occupational exposures. As a 
result,  convincing management  to spend  valuable  funds  to further  reduce  radiation  exposures 
can be a problem. The ALARA program must have the support and active participation of all levels of  management.  It must  be understood  by the  worke r in the field  and receive  his or her 
continued support and attention.  
 
Detailed  guidance  on developing and implementing  an effective ALARA  Program  is provided  in

The details  of the external  dosimetry  program  are discussed  in Chapter  6 of this Technical 
Standard and in DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a). 
 
3.2.4 Internal  Dosimetry  Program  
 
The details  of the internal dosimetry  program  are discussed  in Chapter  5 of this Technical 
Standard and in DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a). 
 
3.2.5 Area  Monitoring  and Control  
 
The details  of the area  monitoring  program  are discussed  in Chapters  4 and 5 of this Technical 
Standard and in DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a). 
 
3.2.5.1  Radiological Surveys  and Data  Trending  
 
Sections 835.401 ‐ 835.403 of 10 CFR Part 835 establish requirements for radiological 
monitoring of areas and individuals. A program of routine, scheduled surveys should be 
established and followed, including surveys in areas that are not ordinarily expect ed to be 
affected  by radiological hazards.  The program  should  define  minimum  requirements,  survey 
type, and frequency.  
 
Surveys  should  be performed  at frequencies  adequate  to identify  changes  in posting  required 
or an activity  buildup  and to ensure  current  radiological controls  are appropriate.  The surveys 
specified by this section should be considered minimum requirements; additional surveys 
should be conducted, recorded, and reviewed as necessary to ensure adequate personnel 
protection.  
 
Surveys should be performed to identify radiological area boundaries and the conditions within those boundaries, the appropriate posting of sources or areas, and the location and 
extent of localized radiological hazards. They should be performed and docume nted prior to 
the start of radiological work, during general work activities at times when changes in 
radiological conditions may occur, and following work to determine that final radiological 
conditions  are acceptable  and documented.  A sufficient  number  of points  should  be surveyed 
to adequately assess the radiological status of the area being surveyed.  
 
Routine radiological surveys should be regularly conducted, recorded, and reviewed for all 
areas where personnel could be exposed to radiation or radioactive material throughout the 
site.  Surveys  should  be performed  at frequencies  adequate  to ensure  protection  of personnel. 
The following surveys should be considered the minimum. Additional surveys should be 
conducted, recorded, and reviewed as necessary to ensure personnel exposures are 
maintained ALARA. General radiation surveys should be performed to : DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
46  
  
a. Identify  and verify  the boundaries  of areas  which  must  be radiologically  controlled ; 
 
b. Verify  that radiation  levels  in uncontrolled  areas  remain  less than  specified  limits ; 
 
c. Determine  the appropriate  posting of localized  higher  radiation  levels,  beams,  or hot 
spots ; 
 
d. Ensure  radiological conditions  are acceptable  and documented  prior  to, during,  and at 
the completion of work that may cause changes in radiation levels to occur ; 
 
e. Satisfy  required  predetermined  procedure  hold‐points  in work  areas  and adjacent  areas, 
whenever operations are performed that may cause significant increases in radiation 
levels . 
 
The survey  may  be required  as part of a radiological inspection  step  required  by the work 
procedure.  
 
This includes  areas  above  and below  the work  area  as appropriate  during special processing 
operations or cell decontamination, movement of permanent or temporary shielding, 
radioactive waste processing, and relocation of highly radioactive materials.  
 
Routine  external  radiation  level  surveys  should  be performed  in the workplace  at a frequency 
commensurate with the radiation hazard, to detect trends related to equipment, systems, 
environment, and work habits. Non‐routine surveys of external radiation levels in the 
workplace should be performed as follows:  
 
a. Before  initial use of a new  installation,  system,  or equipment,  or as soon  as possible 
after a radiation source is brought into the area ; 
 
b. Whenever  changes  in procedures,  equipment,  or sources  have  occurred  that may  cause 
changes in the external radiation levels ; 
 
c. After  modification  to a shield  or changes  in shield  materials ; 
 
d. As the basis  for trend  evaluation  of external  radiation  level  conditions ; 
 
e. When  a radiological  accident  has occurred  or is suspected;  
 
f. When  requested  by the personnel  performing  the activity . 
 
A sufficient  number  of points  should  be surveyed  to adequately  assess the radiological status  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
47  
 of the area.  Regular predetermined  points  may  be used,  but additional  spot  monitoring  should 
be done  to ensure  all changes in dose rates  are identified, recorded,  and reviewed.  All records 
of surveys should clearly identify, as a minimum, the : 
 
a. Name,  signature,  and employee  number  of the surveyor ; 
 
b. Survey  instrument(s)  model  number,  serial number,  and calibration  date ; 
 
c. Type(s)  of radiation  being monitored  (e.g.,  neutron,  gamma) ; 
 
d. Dose  rates; 
 
e. Estimated  doses  to surveyors  (from  direct‐reading  dosimeters, if applicable) ; 
 
f. Date  and time  the survey  was performed . 
 
g. Locations  where  radioactive  material is located  temporarily  (or is being temporarily 
stored) or where equipment that generates ionizing radiation is being operated  
 
Records  of the  results  of radiation  surveys  should  be retained  in accordance with  10 CFR § 
835.701(b)  which  requires  retention  of records  until  final disposition  is authorized  by DOE.  
 
Survey data should be reviewed by the facility radiological control supervisor. Significant 
findings  should  be presented  to the facility  manager in a timely  manner.  Radiological control 
personnel should summarize survey data in each building or area at least once a month.  
Significant changes or trends in area dose rates and/or radiological contamination should be 
noted  and corrective  actions  assigned.  The survey  summary  should  be presented  to the facility 
management monthly.  
 
Survey  results  and data  summaries  should  be made  available  to the ALARA  committee 
periodically and should be used to : 
 
a. Provide  a basis  for evaluating  potential  worker  exposure  on a job and in ALARA 
preplanning ; 
 
b. Provide  a baseline  for trend  analysis,  investigation,  and correction  of unusual  conditions ; 
 
c. Track the status of jobs (including identification of good practices) and detect 
departures  from  good  operating procedures  and/or  the failure  of radiation  
controls ; 
 
d. Identify  the origin  of radiation  exposures  in the plant  by location,  system, or component . DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
48  
 Radiological control  personnel  should  post  survey  maps  at the entrance  to all radiological 
areas so personnel can be aware of radiological conditions within the area.  
 
A survey data trending program should be conducted to indicate the continuing effectiveness 
of existing  control,  to warn  of deterioration  of control  equipment  or effectiveness  of operating 
procedures, to show long‐term variations in radiation levels, and to identify and correct 
improper radiation work practices . 
 
Radiological control  personnel  should  perform  trend  analyses  on all permanent  radiological 
areas. At a minimum, one complete survey record should be evaluated and included in the 
trend analysis program for each survey required to be performed by the facility routine 
control program.  
 
Radiological control personnel should use the facility reporting system to identify 
discrepancies and abnormal trends and should summarize the data review results in their 
monthly reports to the radiological control manager. Survey data trends should be 
investigated when either an upward trend occurs, causing a significant increase (10% or 
more),  or an abrupt  change  in conditions  occurs  that cannot  be directly  correlated  to normal 
activities.  
 
3.2.5.2  Instrumentation Considerations  
 
Instrumentation performance criteria are necessary for portable, fixed, and emergency 
monitoring instrumentation.  There are also requirements  for instrument  calibration  and 
testing.  
 
General  Performance  Criteria  for Instruments  
 
Programs for in‐plant monitoring of uranium consist mainly of airborne and surface 
contamination surveys and dose rate surveys. The general and specific performance criteria 
for the instrumentation  needed  to conduct  these  programs  are described  in ANSI  N317‐1980, 
Performance Criteria for Instrumentation Used for In‐Plant Plutonium Monitoring (1980).  
Performance specifications are also given in IEEE/ANSI N323AB‐2013 (2014), Radiation Protection Instrumentation Test and Calibration, Portable Survey Instruments ; IEEE/ANSI 
N42.17A‐2003, Performance Specifications for Health Physics Instrumentation ‐ Portable 
Instrumentation for Use in Normal Environmental Conditions (2004a); IEEE/ANSI N42.17C‐ 1989, Performance Specifications for Health Physics Instrumentation ‐ Portable 
Instrumentation for Use in Extreme  Environmental  Conditions  for portable  radiological control 
instrumentation (1990b); and IEC Publication 60325:2002, Radiation Protection Instrumentation – Alpha, beta and alpha/beta (beta energy >60 keV) contamination meters 
and monitors (2002b) , for alpha and beta contamination meters and monitors. Criteria for air 
monitoring instrumentation are provided in ANSI/HPS N13.1‐ 2021 , Sampling and Monitoring 
Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
49  
 (2011a); IEC Publication 60761, Equipment for Continuously Monitoring Radioactivity in 
Gaseous  Effluents  (2002a) ; and ANSI  N42.17B‐1989,  Performance  Specifications  for Health 
Physics  Instrumentation ‐ Occupational  Airborne  Radioactivity  Monitoring Instrumentation 
(1990a). Criticality alarm systems are discussed in ANSI/ANS 8.3‐1997, Criticality Accident 
Alarm  System (1997) . The criteria discussed  in the following  sections  are specified  in these 
standards as referenced.  
 
Portable  Monitoring  Instruments  
 
ANSI  N317 (1980)  discusses  several  criteria related  to the performance  of portable  monitoring 
instruments:  
 
a. The overall  accuracy  should  be within  ±20%,  and the precision  should  be within  ±10%  at 
the 95% confidence level.  
 
b. The response time (i.e., the time for the instrument reading to go from zero to 90% of 
full scale)  should  be <10 seconds  on the most  sensitive  scale  and <2 seconds  at readings 
of 100 mrem/h, 100 mR/h, and 500 dpm or greater. (This criterion is unrealistic with 
current neutron instrument capabilities. Response time is typically 30 to 60 seconds.)  
 
c. The instrument  should  be able  to maintain  accuracy  and precision  for a minimum  of 24 
hours of continuous operation.  
 
d. The instrument  should  have  a minimum  battery  lifetime  of 200 hours  of continuous 
operation. ANSI N42.17A (2004a) specifications differ slightly.  
 
e. The response  of the instrument  should  not change  by more  than  ±15%  from  a reference 
value taken at 20°C over the anticipated temperature range for operation.  
 
f. The instrument system should function within specifications over all anticipated combinations  of temperature and humidity  (e.g.,  15° to 65°C,  40%  to 95%  relative 
humidity).  
 
ANSI N317 (1980) states the minimum detection capability for alpha monitoring instruments 
ideally  should  be 220 dpm/100  cm
2 of surface  area and  should  not be more  than  500 dpm/100 
cm2. This criterion should be met in the presence of a radiation field of 0.10 rem/h of neutrons 
in the energy range of thermal to 10 MeV, and/or in the presence of 0.10 rem/h of photons in 
the energy range of 0.010 to 1.25 MeV. The operating range should be from 0 dpm to at least 
100,000 dpm/100 cm2 of surface area. The response of the instrument to beta‐interfering 
radiation is an important specification that should be stated by the manufacturer.  
 
Photon  monitoring  instruments  should  meet  the accuracy  criteria stated  in ANSI  N317  (1980)  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
50  
 over the energy range of 0.01 to 1.25 MeV. The angular response of this type of instrument 
should  be within  ±15%  over  a 2 pi steradian  frontal direction  using at least  two photon  sources 
with energies ranging from 0.06 to 1.25 MeV. Experience has shown this response 
specification is not met by most instruments at lower energies due to attenuation of the 
photon. The energy dependence should be within ±15% over the range of 0.01 to 1.25 MeV 
and the operating range should be from 0.5 mR/h to at least 5000 mR/h. Experience has 
shown that ±20% over 0.01 to 1.25 MeV is more realistic. This sp ecification applies to a 
specific window selection (e.g., below 0.05 MeV, the electron equilibrium cap or beta shield must be removed).  
 
ANSI  N42.17A  (2004a)  has a broader  scope  than  ANSI  N317  (1980),  but the criteria  in it apply 
to portable survey instruments. Additional criteria include geotropism (maximum change of 6% from reference reading for all orientations), temperature shock, mechanical shock, 
vibration, and ambient pressure (maximum change of 15% from reference read ing for the 
latter four criteria). Some differences exist between ANSI N42.17A and ANSI N317. In most cases, the criteria for ANSI N42.17A are more applicable because th ese criteria are based on 
substantial testing, which was sponsored by DOE. In ANSI N42.17A, precision is tied into a 
measurement level; for example, it quotes a precision of 15% at <500 cpm and 10% at >500 
cpm. Also, with the advent of liquid crystal displays and other digital readouts, "response 
time" is defined as the time it takes for the reading to move from 10% to 90% of the 
equilibrium or steady‐state reading. Another significant difference in the standard is the 
battery lifetime specification is 100 hours instead of the 200 hours mentioned in ANSI  N317.  
 
For direct  alpha  contamination  surveys,  the use of audible  signals  (headphones  or speaker) 
greatly facilitates the detection of "hot spots." IEC Publication 60325 (2002b) provides 
additional guidance  on the uniformity  of probe  response  for alpha  and beta  contamination 
meters. Surface sensitivity measurements are also discussed in this standard.  
 
Performance  Criteria  for Fixed  Monitoring  Instruments  
 
Airborne contamination monitors, surface contamination monitors, and photon area 
monitors,  and emergency  instrumentation  are fixed  monitoring  instruments  subject  to the 
following standard performance criteria.  
 
Airborne Contamination Monitors. Airborne contamination monitors, normally CAMS should 
meet the following  criteria  according to  ANSI N317 (1980).  The primary purpose  of any CAM  is 
to detect the presence of airborne radioactivity and activate an alarm to warn personnel in  
the area so actions can be taken to minimize personnel exposures. The goal for any CAM 
should be to perform this function as quickly as possible and at the lowest detectable level of 
radioactive airborne concentration. The quantity of airborne radioactivit y that will result in an 
alarm  within  a given time interval is defined  in units of  DAC‐h  for a particular radionuclide  and 
is a function  of the nuclide’s  airborne  concentration  in DACs,  the sampling rate,  the lower  limit  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
51  
 of detection  of the instrument,  and the time  needed  for the alarm  to occur.  Mishima et al. 
(1988) provides guidance on each of these functions.  
 
ANSI  N42.17B  (1990a)  provides  additional  performance criteria for air monitors  used  to detect 
uranium. This standard provides specifications for general criteria (e.g., sampler design, units 
of readout, alarm threshold), electronic criteria (alarms, stability, response  time, coefficient of 
variation, and line noise susceptibility), radiation response, interfering responses 
(radiofrequency, microwave, electrostatic, and magnetic fields), environmental criteria 
(temperature,  humidity,  and pressure),  and air‐circuit  criteria.  More  detailed  specifications  are 
provided in ANSI N42.17B than in ANSI N317 (1980); however, the environmental criteria and 
the limits of variation are not as restrictive as those in ANSI N317. With respect to accuracy, ANSI N317 requires less than ±20%, and ANSI N42.17B requires 40% at the 95% confidence 
level. For the environmental criteria, ANSI N317 requires that the readings change less than  
5% under ambient conditions, while ANSI N42.17B gives a 15% limit of variation. As discussed 
previously, criteria from ANSI N42.17B are more applicable because they are supported by 
instrument testing.  
 
ANSI N13.1 ( 2021 ) provides detailed guidance on sampling methods from stacks and ducts. 
One criterion that relates to CAMs is that air sample lines between air inlet and filter media 
should be eliminated where possible; where not possible, they should be designed to meet  
the sampling criteria contained  in the standard  (e.g.,  short  lines,  proper  sampling rate,  smooth 
bends). The use of Tygon tubing as sample lines should be minimized or eliminated. Air in‐ 
leakage  from  surrounding areas  can be a problem  when  using sampling  lines.  Testing  for air in‐ 
leakage should be performed at least annually or when seals or "O" rings are replaced.  
 
Surface Contamination Monitors. Surface contamination monitors include hand and/or shoe 
counters and instruments (or probes) with sufficient flexibility to survey pieces of equipment, including exterior  clothing.  ANSI  N317  (1980)  states these instruments  should  have  an audible 
alarm, a frequency that is proportional to the count rate, or a pre‐selectable trip setting, and 
upon reaching that level, should activate an audible or visible alarm or both. These 
instruments should be calibrated according to the re quirements in ANSI N323AB (2014) and 
be equipped  with  a check source.  Fixed  instruments  should  be powered  by alternating  current 
(AC) and provided with an emergency power source.  
 
Performance  Criteria  for Emergency  Instrumentation 
 
Meeting  the criteria for criticality  accident  alarm  systems, fixed  nuclear  accident  dosimeters, 
and other emergency instrumentation is essential.  
 
Criticality  Accident  Alarm  Systems  (CAAS).  See section  7.0 for discussion  of nuclear  criticality 
safety, including CAAS.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
52  
 Fixed  Nuclear Accident  Dosimeters.  All DOE  facilities  that have  sufficient  quantities  and kinds 
of fissile material to potentially constitute a critical mass should provide nuclear accident 
dosimetry. Requirements for fixed nuclear accident dosimeters are found in 10 CFR Part 
835.1304 and DOE Order 420.1C  Chg 3 , Facility Safety (201 9b). 
 
Effluent  Monitors.  Facilities  should  evaluate  potential  emissions in accordance  with  ANSI/HPS 
N13.1 ( 2021 ) to determine the need for stack sampling and/or monitoring.  
 
Other Emergency Instrumentation. Other emergency instrumentation should provide ranges 
for all radiation  dose  rates  and contamination  levels potentially  encountered  at the time  of an 
accident. Normally, dose rate capabilities from a few millirem per hour to a few hundred rem 
per hour should be required while capability requirements for the contamination level may 
range upward from 200 dpm/100 cm2 for alpha contaminants and 1000 dpm/100 cm2 for 
beta‐gamma emitters. Performance specifications for emergency radiological monitoring 
instrumentation can be found in ANSI N320‐1979, Performance Specifications for Reactor 
Emergency Radiological Monitoring Instrumentation (1979) and BNWL‐1742, Technological 
Consideration in Emergency Instrumentation Preparedness. Phase II‐B ‐ Emergency 
Radiological and Meteorological Instrumentation for Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facilities 
(Andersen et al. 1974).  
 
Instrument  Calibrations  and Testing  
 
Radiation doses and energies in the work areas should be well characterized. Calibration of instruments shall be conducted where possible under conditions and with radiation energies 
similar to those encountered at the workstations. Knowledge of the work a rea radiation 
spectra and instrument energy response should permit the application of correction factors when it is not possible to calibrate with a source that has the same energy spectrum. All 
calibration sources should be traceable to recognized national standards. When the work areas  have  been  well characterized,  the calibration  facility  used  by the uranium  facility  should 
be set up to represent as closely as possible the work area’s radiation fields.  
 
DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and ANSI N323AB (2014) provide guidance on 
radiation monitoring instrument calibration. The reproducibility of the instrument readings should be known prior to  making  calibration  adjustments.  This is particularly  important  if the 
instrument  has failed  to pass a periodic performance test (i.e., the instrument response varies 
by more than ±20% from a set of reference readings using a check source) or if the instrument has been repaired. The effect of energy dependence, temperature, humidity, ambient 
pressure, and source‐to detector geometry should be known when performing the primary 
calibration. Primary calibration should be performed at least annually.  
 
Standards referenced in Section 3.5.2 discuss specific performance testing of radiation detection  instruments.  Testing  procedures  in these  standards  should  be used  for periodic  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
53  
 requalification  of instruments  or detailed  testing  of instruments.  
 
The calibration of photon monitoring instruments over the energy range from a few keV to  
300 keV is best accomplished with an x‐ray machine and appropriate filters that provide 
known x‐ray spectra from a few kiloelectron volts to approximately 300 keV. Radionuclide 
sources should be used for higher energies. Most ion chambers used to measure p hoton 
radiations  have  a relatively  flat energy  response  above  80 to 100 keV;  137Cs or 60Co are typically 
used to calibrate these instruments. These sources also should  be used to calibrate Geiger‐ 
Mueller (GM) type detectors. It should be noted that some GM detectors (e.g., those with no 
energy compensation) can show a large energy dependence, especially below approximately 
200 keV.  
 
Whenever  possible,  beta  detectors  should  be calibrated  to the beta  energies  of interest  in the 
workplace. A natural or depleted uranium slab source can be used for calibration of beta detectors when beta radiations in the workplace have energies similar to the uranium.  
International  Organization  for Standardization  beta  sources  should  be used  for all other 
purposes: the energy dependence of beta detectors can be tested using the calibration 
sources listed in the ISO Publication 6980‐1, Nuclear Energy –  Reference Beta Particle 
Radiation (2006), which include 
90Sr, 90Y, 204Tl, and 147Pm. 
 
The calibration and testing of crucial monitoring systems are extremely important to the 
overall radiation  protection  program,  but have  often  been  neglected.  Effluent  monitoring  and 
sampling systems (when present) and remote area monitoring systems should be given 
several tests. The radiological, environmental, and mechanical characteristics of the 
instrumentation  portion  of the system  should  be fully  evaluated  prior to its first use to ensure 
its compatibility with performance requirements and facility operating conditions. The 
effluent samplin g losses from the sample probe to the collector/detector should be 
determined. This test should be repeated at least annually and when a significant change in 
the sampling equipment is made. The sample probe should be examined at least once a year 
to verif y its design or performance has not been changed by corrosion. The recorder of the 
sample flow rate should be calibrated when it is installed and annually thereafter. The 
operability of the overall system should be completely tested once, with repeat tests  only 
after modification, repair, or maintenance. Operability checks should be scheduled at least 
monthly and calibration performed at least annually.  
 
The operation of criticality or other radiation alarm signal systems should be checked periodically to ensure the alarms are audible at all potentially occupied locations (ANSI/ANS, 1997). To prevent any desensitizing of staff, the staff should be aware th e tests will be 
performed, and where possible, tests should be scheduled during off‐shift hours. Building 
systems should be tested semiannually and the area‐wide system should be tested at least 
annually. Any portion of the detector/alarm system affected b y the test should be 
reconfirmed  for operability  after the test is completed  (e.g.,  if a detector  is disconnected  and a DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
54  
 signal is injected  at that point,  the detector  should  be tested  immediately  after it has been 
reconnected).  
3.2.6 Radiological  Controls  
 
3.2.6.1  Work  Authorizations  
 
Written authorizations shall be required to control entry into and work within radiological 
areas and shall specify radiation protection measures commensurate with the existing and 
potential hazards (10 CFR Part 835.501(d)). ALARA considerations need to be included in the 
work  authorization.  One approach  that works  well is the inclusion  of an ALARA  worksheet  with 
the radiological work permit (RWP). Although the written work authorizations may take any 
appropriate form (e.g., written procedures, policy statements, technical work documents), 
RWPs are most often used. RWP s should be used for entry into high and very high radiation 
areas, high contamination areas, and airborne radioactivity areas. RWPs should also be used  
to control entry into radiation and contamination areas and for handling materials with 
removable contamination. The RWPs should be initiated by the work group responsible for  
the activity. All RWPs should be reviewed and approved by the radiological control staff and 
cognizant line management. DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) provides detailed guidance for 
RWPs.  
 
Radiological workers should read and understand the applicable RWP before entering the 
affected  area.  Copies of the RWP  should  be located  at the access  point  to the applicable  area. 
Workers should acknowledge by signature or through electronic means that they have read, 
understood, and will comply with the RWP before they initially enter the area and after 
changes. Out‐of‐date RWPs should be removed.  
 
3.2.6.2  Facility  Posting  and Labeling  
 
Radiological areas,  controlled  areas,  and radioactive  material areas  shall be posted,  unless  the 
conditions constituting the authorized exceptions specified in 10 CFR Part 835 exist (10 CFR  
§835.601‐  § 835.606).  DOE  Guide  G‐441.1‐1C  Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐
2017 (2017b ) provide  appropriate  guidance.  The technical  criteria for defining the required  
areas  should  be established, documented, and consistently applied. The radiological control 
staff should establish and document the conditions that require areas to be barricaded and 
marked to prevent personnel from inadvertently entering them and to be physically lock ed to 
preclude unauthorized personnel from entering them.  
 
Entrance  to areas  where  radioactive  materials  are used  or stored  should  be controlled  in 
accordance with 10 CFR § 835.501.  The degree of control shall be commensurate with 
existing and potential radiological hazards within the area.  
 
The radiological control  staff  should  post  current  surveys  at the access  control  point  for use in 
pre‐job planning. Additional precautions, such as protective clothing, dosimetry, and  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
55  
 respiratory  protection  requirements  should  also be posted.  
 
3.2.6.3  Unposted  Areas  
 
Certain areas of facilities that handle radioactive materials should be maintained free of 
detectable radioactive contamination. These areas should also be maintained at ambient 
radiation  levels  equivalent  to the environmental  background  of the facility.  Parts  of the facility 
that should meet these requirements include lunchrooms, offices, restrooms, janitor rooms, 
corridors outside operational areas, foyers, and outside areas surrounding the facility, 
including building roofs.  
 
To determine that these areas meet the requirements of non‐radioactive cleanliness, they should be surveyed with count‐rate instruments sensitive to the radioactive isotopes of 
interest.  These clean  areas  should  be maintained  below  the detection  levels  cited  in 10 CFR 
Part 835.  
 
3.2.6.4  Visits  by Regulatory  Personnel  
 
Periodically, personnel from DOE and other Federal and state agencies visit radiological 
facilities for audit purposes or to discuss regulatory changes. In most cases, they will look at 
records  of the radiation  protection  program  and,  in some  cases,  will also enter  posted  areas  of 
the facility. These regulatory personnel should have ready access to the facility; provided that applicable training, dosimetry, and other requirements are met. They should have complete 
access to facility personnel knowledgeable in the subjects they wish to discuss. New 
commitments req uested should be referred to the appropriate facility and DOE management.  
 
3.2.7 Emergency  Exposure  Situations  
 
Requirements  and guidance  for emergency  exposure  situations  are discussed  in detail in 
Chapter 9 of this Technical Standard.  
 
3.2.8 Nuclear  Accident  Dosimetry  
 
Nuclear  accident  dosimetry  is discussed  in detail in Chapter  6 of this Technical  Standard.  
 
3.2.9 Records  
 
The systematic  generation  and retention  of records  relating  to the occupational  radiological 
control program are essential to describe the occupational radiation dose received by 
individuals and the conditions under which the exposures occurred. Such records have potential value for medical, epidemiological, and legal purposes.  
 
10 CFR Part 835 establishes  radiation  protection  program  records  requirements.  Section 
835.701(b) states that, unless otherwise specified, records shall be retained until final DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
56  
 disposition is authorized by DOE. An acceptable program for generating and administering 
occupational  radiation  protection  program  records  and reports  to maintain  compliance  with 
the provisions of 10 CFR §835.702, § 835.703, and § 835.704 are described in chapter 13 of DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a). 
 
Most of the required radiological records have established retention periods. The retention periods are discussed in DOE O 243. 1C, Records Management Program  (2022e) . Individual 
records may  be covered  by the Privacy  Act; DOE has codified  its Privacy  Act regulations  in 10 
CFR Part 1008, Records Maintained on Individuals (Privacy Act) . 
 
3.2.10  Radiation Safety  Training  
 
A thorough radiation safety training program shall be established at uranium facilities.  
Training programs should ensure that personnel have the training to work safely in and  
around  radiological areas  and to maintain  their  individual radiation  exposure  and the radiation 
exposures of others ALARA. Separate training programs should be established for general employees and radiological workers. DOE’s core training materials should form the basis for 
the training  programs,  and should  be augmented  with  site‐specific  information.  The training  of 
all staff members shall be documented and records maintained to demonstrate compliance 
with  10 CFR § 901.  DOE  G 441.1‐1C  Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 
(2017b ) provide  guidance on information to be presented du ring the training programs.  
 
DOE requires  biennial  radiation  safety  training  for general employees  and radiological workers 
and when there is a significant change to radiation protection procedures. In the alternate 
year when retraining is not performed, refresher training should be provided. Individuals who 
work with uranium should have special uranium facilities training in addition to or as part of 
the appropriate level of Radiological Worker Training.  
 
3.2.10.1  Radiological Worker  Training  
 
Before working in uranium operations, all radiological workers should be trained and 
qualified.  A thorough  radiation  protection  training  program  should  be established  at uranium 
facilities. Before beginning uranium training, each uranium worker should receive General 
Employee Radiological Training or either Rad Worker I or Rad Worker II Training.  
 
The level of radiation worker training should be determined in accordance with the Table 3‐1 
of DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 . All training shall be consistent with 10 CFR § 835.901 and should be 
consistent  with  the guidance  provided  in DOE G 441.1‐1C  Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a). All 
training  dispositions  and records shall be documented in accordance with 10 CFR § 835.704.  
 
3.2.10.2  Training  for Other  Facility  Personnel  
 
Non‐radiological workers  in a uranium  facility  should  be given  a general orientation  on the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
57  
 radiation  safety  concerns  for working  with  uranium,  the general protective  measures  used  for 
work with uranium, and the engineered safety features of the facility.  DOE has developed 
General Employee Radiological Training for this purpose.  
 
3.2.10.3  Members  of the Public  
 
Members  of the public  with  a demonstrated  need  to enter  the following  areas  may  be allowed 
access  if such  access  is controlled  with  a combination  of training  and the use of escorts  trained 
for the specific area:  
 
a. Radiological Buffer Areas  
 
b. Radiation  and High Radiation  Areas  
 
c. Contamination  Areas 
 
d. Radioactive  Material Areas  
 
Guidance for training of members of the public is provided in DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin 
Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b). Individuals under 18 years of age should not 
be permitted to enter radiation  areas or contamination areas without  the approval of the 
radiological  control manager. Area entry requirements and access restrictions for members of 
the public should be established in facility procedures. Members of the public should be 
prevented from entering very high radiation, high contaminatio n, and airborne radioactivity 
areas.  In accordance with 10 CFR § 835.208, the total effective dose limit for members of the 
public exposed  to radiation  and/or  radioactive  material during access  to a controlled  area is 
0.1 rem in a year.  
 
All facility  personnel  serving  as a qualified  escort  should  ensure  that each  visitor  under  his/her 
cognizance completes a facility radiological visitor form. The qualified escort should also sign the visitor form and complete it as appropriate.  
 
Facility‐sponsored  visitors  should  provide  the following  before  entering  radiological areas, 
unless these records have already been entered into the facility entry control system:  
 
a. Evidence  of completing required  training,  as applicable  
 
b. Visitor  radiation  exposure disclosure  
 
c. A medical  disclosure  form  or the results  of a medical evaluation  
 
The host  facility  manager should  forward  the visitor  radiation  exposure  and medical disclosure 
forms to Dosimetry.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
58  
 If there are members of the public who live or work near a uranium facility, a plan for 
orientation of  members  of the public should  be developed  to inform  them of  facility activities. 
Such a plan should include information on the concerns that require protection of people  
from potential injuries by uranium, the general protective measures used at the facility to 
confine  it and keep  it out of the public  domain,  and solicitation  of information  on the concerns 
of members of the local public about uranium. To the extent possible, efforts should be made 
to allay those concerns. The information in the public education plan should also be provided 
to local news media.  
 
3.3 Related  Programs  
 
3.3.1 Onsite  Packaging  and Transportation  
 
The hazardous materials organization conducts onsite radioactive shipments with the 
assistance of radiological  control. This program requires the hazardous materials organization 
representatives to review onsite radioactive shipping records, document the errors or 
omissions observed, and evaluate trends and revise training as needed. Serious deficiencies 
are to be documented  and the reports  should  be submitted  in accordance  with  DOE  O 460. 1D 
Chg 1 , Hazardous Materials Packaging and Transportation Safety (2022c). 
 
The packaging  organization  is responsible  for coordinating onsite  package  design  and prepara‐ 
tion of safety analysis  documentation. The following sections describe  typical  process, review, 
and approval requirements for onsite safety analysis documentation.  
 
3.3.1.1  Initiation  
 
New safety analysis documentation or reviews/changes to existing documentation can be 
requested by a user organization based on programmatic or operational requirements. The 
request  is submitted in writing to the packaging organization  and includes proper justification 
and support  documentation.  The packaging  organization  makes  routine  revisions  as necessary 
to reflect policy and regulation changes.  
 
3.3.1.2  Preparation  
 
The packaging  organization  coordinates  the analysis,  prepares  safety  analysis  documentation, 
and guides the documentation through the review and approval process, including the 
resolution of review comments and the obtaining of required approval.  
 
3.3.1.3  Control  
 
Safety  analysis  documentation  is prepared  and maintained  according  to facility  policy.  The 
document control system provides an accessible, auditable, and retrievable method for 
maintaining and changing safety analytic documentation.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
59  
 3.3.1.4  Review and Approval  Cycle  
 
Safety  analysis  documentation  is reviewed,  approved,  and changed  according  to facility  policy. 
Additional reviews and approvals include the following people and organizations:  
 
a. User  
 
b. Cognizant  engineer  
 
c. Packaging  organization  
 
d. Quality  assuran ce 
 
e. Responsible  environmental  assurance  organization,  onsite  only 
 
f. Packaging,  shipping,  and waste  safety  assurance  organization  
 
g. Criticality  engineering analysis,  if criticality  analysis  is required  
 
h. Packaging  and shipping approval  authority  
 
i. DOE field  office,  if the package  is to be used  for Highway  Route  Controlled  Quantity 
inter‐area shipments  
 
3.3.2 Approval  for Editorial  Changes  
 
Inconsequential  editorial changes  to a safety  analysis  document  may  be approved  at the 
operating level.  
 
3.3.2.1  Utilization  
 
Once a safety analysis document is approved, copies are sent to the affected organizations, 
including operations and applicable facility engineering, to incorporate the administrative 
controls from the safety analysis document into the affected operating d ocuments. User 
organizations  must  obtain  the packaging  organization  review  of all operating  procedures  that 
incorporate instructions or administrative controls found in COCS, SARPS, SEPS, DAPS, DOT exemptions, and Federal and state packaging requirements t o ensure that they are properly 
incorporated.  
 
Onsite  packages  currently  approved  for onsite  use should  be cataloged  and described  in a 
hazardous materials packaging directory maintained by the packaging organization. New 
packages are added to the directory as they are developed and approved.  
 
3.3.3 Conduct  of Operations  
 
The organization  and administration  of operations  should  ensure  a high  level  of performance  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
60  
 in DOE  facility  operations is  achieved through  effective  implementation  and control  activities. 
Administration of operations activities should recognize that protection of the environment, 
maintaining  a high‐quality  safety  program  and productivity  are compatible  goals.  DOE  policies 
and standards describe the standards of excellence under which the facility is expected to 
operate. Clear lines of responsibility for normal and emergency conditions must be 
established. Effective implementation and control of operating activities are achieved 
primarily by having readily accessible written standards for operations, periodical monitoring 
and assessment of performance, and personnel accountability for performance. For a more 
detailed discussion, see DOE Order 422.1  Chg 4 , Conduct of Operations ( 2022a ). 
 
A high  level of performance  in DOE  operations  is accomplished  by management  establishing 
high  operating  standards  and then  by communicating the operating  standards  to workers  by 
providing sufficient resources to the operations department, ensuring personnel are well 
trained by closely monitoring performance in operations, and holding workers and their 
supervisors accountable for their performance in conducting activities.  
 
Senior management establishes operating standards, considering input from workers when 
appropriate. Working‐level personnel will more strongly support the standards when they 
have had appropriate input into their development. Standards should define operat ing 
objectives, establish expected performance levels, and clearly define responsibilities in plant 
operations. Standards for operating activities should be integrated into operations 
department procedures and programs. Operating standards should also be c ommunicated to 
workers by training them in operating practices and by having supervisors monitor and guide work  involving  facility  operations.  Sufficient  staff,  facilities,  equipment,  and funding should  be 
allocated to permit the operations department to effectively perform its functions.  
Performance in operations should be closely monitored by facility management, preferably using operating reports and goals, so the performance of the operations department can be 
effectively  measured.  Operations  personnel  should  be held  accountable  for their  performance 
through supervisor counseling, performance appraisals, and, when necessary, disciplinary 
measures. Remedial training should be provided when appropriate.  
 
The radiological control  organization,  as a support  element,  must  ensure  that all aspects  of 
radiation safety are considered in the establishment of operations standards and policy. A well‐instituted cooperative relationship between operations and radiological control is 
paramount to the health and safety of workers and the public and to protec tion of the 
environment.  
 
A uranium facility must have a written policy on radiation protection, including an ALARA 
policy. All radiation protection procedures and controls must have recognizable or formal 
technical  bases  for limits,  methods,  and personnel  protection  standards.  Procedures  must  be 
adequately  documented,  updated  periodically,  and maintained  in a centralized  historical  file. 
A control system should be established to assure all copies are accounted for and all new  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
61  
 procedures are included in the historical files. A designated period of time for holding the 
historical files should be established, which is authorized by DOE in accordance with 10 CFR § 
835.701(b). ANSI N13.6‐2010 provides guidance on historical files. I n addition, radiological 
control procedures should have a documented approval system and established intervals for 
review  and/or  revision.  A tracking  system  should  be developed  to ensure  the required  reviews 
and revisions occur.  
 
3.3.3.1  Radiological Work  Procedures  
 
Radiological work procedures, including RWPs, survey procedures, ALARA reviews, sample 
counting, and other task procedures, fall within the requirements for conduct of operations. 
All sections of DOE Order 422.1 Chg 4 ( 2022a ) apply. Procedures are a key factor affecting 
radiation protection performance. 10 CFR Part 835.104 requires written procedures.  
Appropriate attention  should  be given to writing,  reviewing,  approving,  and monitoring  
implementation  of radiation protection procedures. There should be documented 
qualification and training requirements for those who prepare and approve procedures. A 
formal approval process should  be established.  Procedure  changes  and revisions  should  be 
subject  to the same  review and approval process as the initial procedure.  
 
Personnel should be trained in the use of the procedures they will be expected to perform. 
For RWPs, workers are required to read the RWP and verify by signature they have read it, 
understand its contents, and will comply with its requirements in the condu ct of the work. 
Procedures  should  be available  for personnel  use. The RWPs  should  be posted  at the entrance 
to the work location. There should be a system in place to assure posted copies of all work procedures, including RWPs, are current.  
 
3.3.3.2  Posting  and Labeling  
 
The requirements for area posting and radioactive material labeling are established in 10 CFR Part 835, Subpart G. Guidance on implementing the regulatory requirements can be found in 
DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b). Conformance to 
conduct of operations requirements should assure a reasonable degree of uniformity in the 
posting and the signs used, as well as verifying that operator aids and other posted 
information do not interfere with necessary radiological postin g. Radiological postings should 
be reviewed in the same  manner  as the posting of operating  aids,  in conformance  with  DOE  
Order  422.1 Chg 4 ( 2022a ). 
 
3.3.3.3  Instrument  Calibration  
 
The status of installed and portable radiological instruments should be well known and 
appropriate  to the use. All instruments  and equipment  used  for monitoring shall meet  the 
requirements of 10 CFR § 835.401.  
 
"Ownership"  of installed  monitoring  instruments  should  be well known  and the responsibility  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
62  
 and authority for calibration, repair, and notification clearly established. Because such 
information is often used by more than one group, formal notification procedures should be 
established  to cover  those  times  when  the instrument  is out of service  or beyond  the required 
calibration schedule. Configuration control and quality assurance requirements for installed 
systems should be established commensurate with their safety significance.  
 
For portable instruments, conduct of operations requirements are normally built into the routine calibration and survey program. Functional checks including source checks are 
routinely made to verify operability, instruments are checked to assure they are within the 
calibration  period,  and survey  procedures  require  identification  of the instruments  used  so if a 
problem is later found, measurements can be repeated.  
 
3.3.3.4  Audits  
 
Conduct  of operations  does  not, in itself,  address  requirements  for auditing.  10 CFR Part 
835.102  requires  an internal audit of  the radiation  protection program  no less frequently than 
36 months. Guidance states that inspections, audits, reviews, investigations, and self‐ 
assessments are part of the checks and balances needed in an operating program. Auditing is 
one of the many tools line management has at its dis posal to identify problems. Each one of 
the 18 topics addressed in DOE Order 422.1 Chg 4 (2022a ) should be subject to both internal 
self‐ assessment and external auditing to assure effe ctive implementation of requirements. 
Any deficiencies identified  should be documented and corrective actions aggressively pursued 
and tracked  to completion.  The self‐assessment  and audit  process  should  include  conducting 
trend analyses and root cause evaluations of deficiencies and communication of results 
throughout the organization.  
 
3.3.3.5  Decommissioning of Weapons  and Weapon  Facilities  
 
Decommissioning of nuclear  weapons  and nuclear  facilities  is subject  to the same  conduct  of 
operations  requirements  as operating facilities.  In general,  some  components,  once  they  are 
separated, can be downgraded in safety significance. Also, facilities undergoing decommissioning will have fewer safety systems.  
 
During decommissioning, status control and shift turnover are extremely important 
considerations.  Posting  of radiological  areas and labeling of radioactive  materials are also an 
increasing challenge because of the rapidly changing radiological status. In extreme cases, it 
may  be desirable  to have  workers  review  or sign the RWP  each  day to ensure  they  are aware 
of the status.  
 
3.3.4 Integrated Safety  Management  
 
The radiological control program must  be developed and implemented in a manner that is 
consistent  with  the DOE  approved  Radiation  Protection  Program  required  by 10 CFR § 835.101 DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
63  
 and should be consistent with the provisions of DOE Policy P 450.4A, Integrated Safety 
Management  Policy (2018 c), and its associated  guidance  documents.  The RPP should  describe 
a system of radiological  controls that can be implemented on a site‐wide basis and tailored to 
meet facility‐and hazard‐specific needs. The program should provide for increasing worker 
involvement in identification and implementation of appropriate controls. Like the ALARA 
process , an effective  integrated  safety management  system  emp hasizes  the development  and 
implementation of controls that are commensurate with the hazards associated with any 
specified activity. Under ISM, both DOE and DOE‐contractor line managers are charged with 
responsibility for integrating safety measures into all facets of work plann ing and execution.  
Line managers  at uranium  facilities  should  use DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017  (2017b ) and this Technical 
Standard as a guide to integrating radiological control measures into work planning and 
execution.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 4 CONTAMINATION CONTROL  
Contamination  control  is an important  part of the overall radiological  control  program.  There 
are four main aspects to this: 1) control of the release of contamination into the work‐place 
environment; 2) control of personnel exposure to the contamination that does get into the 
work place; 3) protection of personnel from intake of contaminants  and 4) prevention of 
release of contamination to the public and the environment. Effective control of personnel 
exposure to uranium and its decay products is accomplis hed mainly by controlling the 
potential for inhalation and ingestion of radioactive materials. Monitoring provides an 
indication of the effectiveness of physical design features and administrative controls in 
controlling exposure to radioactive material.  
 
This chapter addresses the basic features of an effective contamination control program and 
the technical considerations of implementing the program. A release of radioactive material 
from containment typically results in surface contamination and airborne  dispersion. Airborne 
contaminants are continuously cleared from the workplace by ventilation. Strategic air 
sampling detects the release of an airborne contaminant and provides the means for control, 
minimization  of personnel  exposure,  and evaluation  of inhalation  exposure.  Considerations  for 
design of an air monitoring program are followed in this chapter by a section on surface 
contamination control. Finally, protection of personnel from contaminant intake is 
accomplished with protective clothing and respiratory protection.  
 
4.1 Air Monitoring  
 
The most common route of uranium intake for workers is by inhalation. Airborne particles 
deposit throughout the respiratory tract. Some of the deposited particles are swallowed, 
contributing to ingestion, requiring that both inhalation and ingestion be considered with an 
exposure to airborne material. The particl e size distribution that determines deposition in the 
respiratory tract is affected by the mechanism of dispersion and the nature of the source 
material. Characterization of inhalation exposure should make use of all available information 
about  the chemica l and physical form  of airborne  material.  This information,  along  with  spatial 
and temporal distribution, provides the basis to minimize personnel exposure for air contamination control.  
 
4.1.1 Internal  Versus  External  Dose  Philosophy  
 
The widespread application of methods to contain uranium in DOE facilities has resulted in a history  of relatively  minor  internal  exposures.  The methods  used  to control  internal dose  have 
been developed for a variety of reasons:  
 
a. The assessment of internal dose requiring bioassay is difficult, imprecise, time‐ 
consuming,  and offensive  to personnel  as compared  to external  dosimetry.  For example, 
an accidental internal uptake may require the subject to submit dozens of biological DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
65  
 samples  over  the span  of many  months,  as well as requiring  extensive  analytical support 
for measurement of sample content, considerable time of trained professionals to 
analyze data and calculate the internal dose, and long lapses before dose estimates are 
available, thus handicapping the assessment of the occupational exposure status  and 
treatment of the worker.  
 
b. Prevention  of internal exposure  is often more  feasible  and successful than  prevention  of 
external exposure. Contained radioactive material may continue to produce external penetrating fields of radiation, but no internal exposure potential. Portable protective devices (respiratory protection equipment) can minimize internal exposure when 
containment is not practical.  
 
c. Recommendations of the ICRP in formulating a dose limit system have resulted in 
combining internal and external dose.  Again,  the difficulty  and time  delay  of internal 
dosimetry make elimination of significant internal exposure an economic incentive.  
 
In facilities that process large quantities of uranium, however, there may be situations in 
which  exposure  to work‐place  airborne  activity  at low levels  occurs  daily.  The fact that tons  of 
material are handled, rather than gram quantities, and that the material is less toxic (on a mass basis because of low specific activity), make total containment impractical.  
 
4.1.2 Purpose  of Air Monitoring  
 
The goal of the air monitoring program is to identify, evaluate, and control internal dose 
received  by workers  from  routine  occupational  exposure  to airborne  radioactive  materials,  to 
confirm that source controls are functioning properly, and to assess the exposure resulting 
from  an unusual  event.  There  are two general  aspects  of air sampling that must  receive  equal 
consideration  in a properly  executed  monitoring  program.  The first involves  the methods  and 
equipment by which a sample is collected and analyzed to yield an accurate measurement of the specific radionuclides. The second is the protocol of sampling location, duration, and 
frequency that focuses on de termination of the radionuclide exposure in the work area.  
 
Air monitoring should include both active and passive air samplers. A continuous air monitor 
(CAM) provides for immediate alarm, warning workers of an unusual release  of high levels of 
airborne radioactive material. This active monitoring is needed for high hazard and high 
potential areas  to provide immediate  and timely  protective  response,  while  passive  sampling 
provides  high‐sensitivity  activity  records,  trends,  continuous  documentation,  etc. Three types 
of air samplers are used to accomplish the air monitoring: general area sampling (GAS), 
breathing zone sampling (BZS), and personal air sampling (PAS).  
 
The CAM  continuously  draws  air through  a sampler  that has an active  radiation  detector.  The 
sampled  air is automatically  monitored  for an increase  above  normal  or background  levels of 
contamination. When airborne activity exceeds the alarm level, workers are warned of the 
potential problem and prompted to follow alarm procedures. This type of monitor is usually  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
66  
 practical only for stationary samplers (GAS or BZS). It is important that a CAM be placed to 
sample  air that accurately  represents  the most  likely  area  of material  release.  This will protect 
most workers from a worst‐case exposure and minimize total work‐force exposure.  
 
4.1.2.1  General Air Samplers  (GAS)  
 
Air sampling is performed at a single point in the general area of a site where work with 
radioactive material is being performed. The sampler is placed in a position to give the best 
overall representation  of the area,  often  in the main  airflow  exiting  the area.  Airflow  patterns 
can be determined by tests with tracer smoke or balloons. This method is typically used to 
measure airborne radioactivity for the following purposes:  
 
a. to determine  if the work‐place  environments  are free of significant  contamination  and 
are inherently safe for routine occupational activities ; 
 
b. to detect  measurable  air activity  which  would  signal the need  for use of respiratory 
protection equipment ; 
 
c. to detect unexpected  loss of containment  or malfunction  of systems (which  may  not be 
detected by a CAM), and provide the basis to initiate corrective actions ; 
 
d. to detect low‐level  trends  in activity  which  can signal a gradual loss of containment  in 
early stages ; 
 
e. to estimate personnel  exposure  retrospectively  and evaluate  compliance  with  applicable 
requirements . 
 
4.1.2.2  Breathing  Zone  Samplers  (BZS)  
 
Breathing zone sampling is performed by placing air samplers in the immediate area in which workers will spend the majority of their time. The intent is to measure the air activity 
concentrations to which the workers are actually exposed. The purposes of breathing zone 
sampling are the same as those listed for general air sampling, but involve a greater number 
of samples, which  gives  more  realistic  information.  Breathing  zone  samplers  give earlier,  more 
sensitive detection of release from containment.  
 
Samples should be collected on a schedule corresponding to individual worker activities to 
best  represent inhalation  exposure.  GAS is generally  not a good  measurement  with  which  to 
estimate internal dose. A well‐placed network of BZS gives a better representation of 
inhalation exposure.  
 
4.1.2.3  Personal Air Samplers  (PAS)  
 
Personal air sampling should give the most realistic measurement of individual worker 
exposure.  This involves  greater expense,  however,  to equip  personnel  with  samplers  and to DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
67  
 process all of the individual samples. Personal air sampling is performed with a small, battery‐ 
powered, low‐volume (approximately 2‐L/min) sampler worn by the worker, with the filter 
located  near  the worker’s  face.  This type  of sampler  is potentially  subject  to many  inaccuracies 
caused by improper handling, which requires trained personnel to handle the equipment operation. Personal air sampling is often used to validate breathing zone sampling strategy  
and to conduct special investigations.  
 
4.1.3 Regulations  and Limits  
 
The regulations, standards, and limits pertaining to exposure of radiation workers to airborne 
activity  in the workplace  are based  on the probability  of injury  to internal organs  and the total 
body by radioactive materials taken into the body. To facilitate control of intake in the 
workplace,  standard‐setting  authorities  have  calculated  derived  air concentration  (DAC)  and 
annual limit on  intake  (ALI) as  a control to limit resultant  dose  to internal organs.  Operational 
hazards are directly controlled by the observance of DAC and ALI values.  
 
The ICRP  and the NCRP  are independent,  non‐governmental  organizations  which  set standards 
and guidance for control of radiation hazards. Governmental agencies implement these 
recommendations by establishing Federal policy for the protection of workers.  
 
Formal rules for air monitoring for DOE facilities are provided in 10 CFR Part 835. Efforts have been made to keep these rules consistent with ICRP Publication 60 (1991a) and NCRP Report 91, Recommendations  on Limits  for Exposure  to Ionizing  Radiation (1987 b). DOE‐STD‐1098‐
2017 (2017 b) detailed guidance on the best practices currently available in the area of 
radiological control. More specific guidance is given in DOE G 441.1 ‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) 
(2011a ), Chapter 10 ‐ Air Monitoring, and technical standards, such as this one.  
 
Limits  of chemical exposure also need  to be monitored,  especially  for materials  of low specific 
activity, such as depleted uranium or non‐radioactive materials. The threshold limit value 
time‐weighted average (TWA) for natural uranium is 0.2 mg m
‐3 (ACGIH, 2005). TWA is the 
chemical analog of DAC. In the case of reactor fuel uranium, enriched to about 3%, this 
corresponds to 4 x 10‐10 µCi mL‐1, which is comparable to the DAC for soluble forms of 
uranium. However, the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit for solu ble uranium is 0.05 mg m‐3, 
which is more restrictive than the DAC. Soluble forms of such materials can be monitored 
directly  by routine  urinalysis,  or indirectly  by BZS and PAS.  Internal  deposits  of insoluble  forms 
may only be estimated by BZS and PAS, as with asbestos, for example.  
 
4.1.4 Theoretical  Considerations  and Uncertainties  
 
A discussion of the theoretical aspects of air contamination monitoring, and inherent 
uncertainties,  should  be useful  in placing  air monitoring  programs  in their  proper  perspective. 
In general, air sampling should not be the primary measurement of internal dose, except 
when bioassay information is unavailable or unobtainable. Evaluation of worker exposure  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
68  
 potential  in terms  of DAC‐hours,  however,  may  be a legitimate  control  measure  and may 
demonstrate compliance with federal directives.  
 
4.1.4.1  Airborne  Concentration  
 
An appropriate air‐sampling method should provide samples which accurately represent the 
average  airborne  concentration  of radioactive  materials  present  in the workplace,  but should 
not be used  as a measurement of individual  exposures,  except in unusual  circumstances.  If air 
activity data must be used for exposure records, these samples should be collected from the 
breathing zones of the workers, or by using an established conversion factor for the existing 
sampler configuration. In contaminated areas subject to significant temporal and spatial 
variations in the activity concentrations, only personal air samples or virtually continuous 
samples collected from within the breathing zone of workers can provide reliable breathing 
zone concentration measurements.  
 
A restricted area, having good ventilation and point sources of contamination, will have 
substantial variations in the activity concentrations observed at different locations,  
particularly if the movements of the workers cause resuspension of the activity. The worker often spends time closer to the source of contaminant dispersion than is the location of the 
nearest  BZS.  Several  researchers  have  investigated  the relationship  between  fixed  air samplers 
and spot  samples  collected  at various  locations  in typic al working  areas.  Discrepancies  as great 
as two orders of magnitude are not unusual.  
 
This deficiency of GAS monitoring for individual exposure records is caused by the high  
dilution factors that tend to reduce the airborne concentrations before and after contamination  reaches  the filter head. Much  of the air sampled  by a GAS originates in  another 
part of the area and does not pass near enough to pick up contamination from the source, 
effectively  reducing the measured  concentration  by dilution  of the collected  sample.  A release 
of activity from a malfunctioning containment system can produce  large activity 
concentrations in the breathing zone of the worker. These concentrations are effectively diluted in an unpredictable manner by one or two orders of magnitude before the 
contamination  reaches  a monitor  located  only  a meter  away.  It has been  demonstrated  that in 
some operations (such as welding over a short period of time) differences of as much as a 
factor of 5 between the right and left lapel PAS measurements can be expected.  
 
Most of the field studies that have compared urinalysis results with air sampling in natural uranium facilities have, in general, indicated very poor correlation between the estimated 
exposures  and the bioassay  data.  This suggests  that individual exposure  records  of uranium 
workers based on GAS methods have limited validity.  
 
The potential  for release  of gaseous  UF
6, and subsequent  generation  of its soluble  hydrolysis 
product UO 2F2, requires special air‐sampling considerations in uranium conversion and 
gaseous diffusion plants, relative to those plants handling less reactive compounds.  In these  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
69  
 plants, effective processing, as well as worker safety, requires a high degree of containment. 
Continuous GAS operation to detect loss of containment, coupled with spot air samples, 
constitute the typical sampling strategy. A study conducted at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant, concluded that shift‐long air samples collected in the general working areas 
were of little use in predicting worker’s urinary uranium e xcretion. The slight correlation 
observed was not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Thus, gaseous 
contaminants  behave  much  like particulate  contaminants  in that localized  concentrations  can 
be much greater than the average concentration measured by GAS. These researchers also 
found  that smear  samples of  alpha  activity on  work surfaces in the  area may provide  a better 
indicator of uranium intake than the GAS records.  
 
Although transuranic material is handled by DOE uranium facilities only as feed 
contamination,  the unusual characteristics  of the transuranic  elements make them  worthy of 
separate consideration. The low maximum permissible concentrations specified for these 
elements and their frequently low specific activities cause extreme difficulties in detection of 
significant airborne activity. Operations involving significan t amounts of elements, such as 
239Pu, should be conducted in a ventilated glove‐box environment  and with monitoring 
systems  capable  of detection  of small  releases  involving 1 DAC  averaged  over  8 hours  (8 DAC‐ 
hours) under laboratory conditions. Special CAMs (GAS) and fixed BZSs are the standard air‐ 
sampling methods used in facilities of this category in the United States.  
 
A clear example of the wide  variations  in observed  air‐activity  concentrations  that can occur 
with different sampling techniques is provided by data from the Three Mile Island Nuclear 
Generating Station, which is typical of operations in a large open building (EGG 1988).  
Between June and September 1983, over 40 multi‐person entries were made into the 
containment  building,  providing 949 work‐hours  of PAS data.  Five stationary  air monitors  were 
operated continuously at strategic locations throughout the building, and each entry was 
preceded by the collection and analysis of a high‐volume grab sample. All samples were 
analyzed by a gamma spectrometer, primarily to detect cesium‐137, and by gr oss beta 
counting.  
 
The five continuous  air samples  exhibited  good  internal  agreement when  averaged  over  either 
12‐ or 24‐hour periods. However, the grab samples averaged a factor of 3 higher than the 
continuous air‐sampler readings, and PAS samples were a factor of 34 higher. The major 
reason for this large difference was attributed to resuspension of the su rface contamination 
by the work in progress. These data, coming from a thoroughly monitored and carefully analyzed air‐sampling effort, are further evidence that GAS metho ds should be viewed with 
caution.  
 
Even when the airborne‐activity concentration in the breathing zone of a worker has been accurately  measured,  there  are other  physical  and physiological parameters  that can produce 
significant uncertainties in dose assessment. The established DACs are derived for each  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
70  
 radionuclide  assuming  a standard  volume  of air breathed  in occupational  situations,  specified 
pathways to critical organs, the "standard man" metabolic and elimination patterns, and the 
physical and biological properties of the isotope. Large variations are encountered, however, 
in breathing rates and tidal volumes (which depend on workin g conditions), and there are 
individual variations in such physiological parameters as lung clearance and metabolic rates. 
The particle‐size distribution of the aerosol and  the actual solubility of the inhaled particles 
can significantly affect the deposition and retention of airborne activity in the respiratory 
tract. The potential uncertainty in the total dose assessment should include consideration of 
all of these factors , as discussed in the following paragraphs.  
 
4.1.4.2  Particle‐Size  Distribution  
 
In the absence of actual measurement of particle‐size distributions, an activity median aerodynamic  diameter  (AMAD)  of 5 µm and a geometric  standard  deviation  (GSD)  of 2 is often 
assumed as a conservative estimate, as laid out in the ICRP Publication 60 (1991a) 
methodology. Particles of this size are likely to result in the greatest deposition in the 
pulmonary region of the lungs. The actual size distribution can be measured with instruments 
such as cascade impactors, but these are not practical for continuous operation in the work‐ 
place environment. Electronic instruments can give continuous information about the optical 
particle  size,  but not the AMAD.  Thus,  particle  size can only  occasionally  be measured  to typify 
the size distribution in a particular situation.  
 
Size‐selective inlets for air samplers have been developed to mimic deposition in the respiratory tract, giving more accurate estimates of deposition in the pulmonary region. Non‐ 
respirable or non‐inhalable particles are removed by the inlet, and the resp irable or inhalable 
fraction is collected on a filter. These devices can be useful in minimizing the dose assessment 
errors resulting from uncertainties regarding the actual aerosol‐size distribution; however, 
they require additional handling and care, and  require separate samplers for total airborne 
activity. If the AMAD is often substantially greater than 1 µm in an area, the addition of 
samplers  with  size‐selective inlets  may  be worthwhile.  Regulations  allowing  the substitution  of 
size‐selective samplers are not established, however, so special arrangements may be needed 
with regulatory agencies.  
 
4.1.4.3  Breathing  Rates  and Tidal Volumes  
 
The actual air intake of a worker can vary from 5 L min‐1 to 100 L min‐1, although typical 
variations from the assumed 20 L min‐1 standard will probably be no larger than a factor of 3. 
Total  air intake  depends  on the rate of breathing and on the volume  of tidal air. The velocity  of 
this air influences the regional deposition of aerosol particles. Newer, more sophisticated lung 
models  include  this breathing‐rate  effect  in calculation  of dose  distribution. Information  about 
individual breathing behavior may be useful in the application of the newer lung dosimetry 
models. Simpler models, such as ICRP Publication 30 (1979), assume that regional deposition  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
71  
 is independent  of breathing  rate,  with  total  deposition  determined  only  by the volume 
breathed.  
 
4.1.4.4  Particle  Solubility  and Lung Clearance  
 
When  particles  are deposited  in the respiratory  tract,  they  are cleared  from  airway  surfaces  by 
several mechanisms. Insoluble particles are cleared by the biomechanical means of 
macrophage and mucociliary transport, while some particles are retained in pulmonary 
tissues. Particles of soluble material dissolve, making the contaminant available for other 
means of transport such as absorption into the blood. Dosimetry of the contaminant depends 
on how fast the particles dissolve.  
 
Rate  of particle dissolution is divided  into three categories  by the ICRP  Publication  68 model 
(1994b). Types F (fast), M (moderate), and S (slow) refer to the rate of absorption of the material in the pulmonary  region  of the lungs.  The approximate  half‐times  of clearance  that 
these absorption rates correspond to are : 
 
• Type  F (fast):  10 min (100%)  
• Type  M (moderate):   10 min (10%);  140 d (90%)  
• Type  S (slow):  10 min (0.1%); 7000  d (99.9%)  
 
A retention half‐time of less than 10 days is retention Type F, a half‐time of 10 to 100 days is 
class  M, and half‐time  greater  than  100 days  is Type  S. Some  materials  have  been  described  to 
have characteristic rates of dissolution and are associated with a particular retention class.  
Many  factors  can affect  the dissolution  rate,  however,  so general assignments  to retention 
classes should be regarded with caution.  
 
The health physicist may have some prior knowledge of the chemical compounds of the nuclides present in an area and may be able to assign them to retention classes. The ICRP 
Publication 60 (1991a) dosimetry model provides for a lung retention class designation of 
aerosols depending on the  rate of dissolution; however,  actual determination of  the lung class 
for dose assessment can best be determined after an exposure utilizing appropriate chemical and bioassay data, but this can only be accomplished in retro spect (ICRP 1991). A prospective 
approach  uses  measured  dissolution  rate of potential  contaminants  for analysis  and treatment 
of an accidental exposure. Determination of retention  class should  be a valuable  precaution in 
uranium facilities.  
 
A realistic determination of retention class can be made by collecting a sample of airborne material by using a size‐selective  sampler  and drawing  the sample  from  a process  that has a 
potential for a significant release. The material collected on the filter represents that which 
would be deposited in the lungs by inhalation. Methods and instruments are now available 
with  the sensitivity  needed  to precisely  measure  the rate of dissolution  of this small  mass  of DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
72  
 uranium  in simulated  lung fluid.  The same  methods  can be used  on filter samples  in operation 
at the time of an accidental exposure, but the time required to measure dissolution rate (at 
least 60 days) makes the information essentially retrospective. Prospective measurement of 
retention class provides for better risk assessment.  
 
4.1.5 Samplers  and Instrumentation 
 
Air sampling equipment and monitors exist in a wide range of designs and capabilities, with characteristics  specific  to the application  and need.  Samplers  range  from  small portable  units 
that can be worn by an individual to high‐volume units permanently mounted in the facility. 
Flow rates are from a few liters per minute to a few cubic meters per minute.  
 
4.1.5.1  Key Factors  in Selecting  Air Samplers  
 
Sensitivity of Detection. In general, the sensitivity required is at least DAC levels; however, in some  applications,  sensitivity  to a small fraction  of DAC  is desired for  early  detection  of loss of 
containment, low level trends, etc. Continuous air monitors may only need to alarm at 
multiple  DAC  levels  in order  to be effective  in preventing or mitigating  personnel  exposures  to 
an accidental airborne release.  
 
Type of Sample. In most uranium facilities, particulates in the air are the primary concern, 
although  gaseous  forms  may  be most  important  in some  areas.  It may  be of interest to collect 
samples  that will allow  characterization  of the particle  size distribution  or define  a "respirable 
fraction." In each application, the sample type will dictate the sampler design, filter media, 
flow rate, etc.  
 
Convenience.  Available  space,  noise  level  tolerance,  portability,  and weight  also dictate 
specific designs and capabilities of air samplers and monitors.  
 
Power  Requirements.  Requirements  for battery‐powered  versus  110‐120‐VAC  line power  may 
dictate sampler selection.  
 
Accuracy. Some sampling is performed to simply detect or make relative measurements of 
activity  levels  for which  the accuracy  requirements  are not great.  In other  situations,  accurate 
measurements of the air breathed by personnel may require an entirely different sampler 
design to achieve the needed quality assurance.  
 
Reliability  and Maintainability.  Cost‐effective operation  and reliability  need  to be considered 
for selection of equipment design and for redundancy of components. Sensitivity to Electromagnetic fields should also be considered.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
73  
 4.1.5.2  Filter Media  
 
Filters should have  high collection efficiencies (i.e., >99%)  for particles over a wide  range of 
sizes.  Many  cellulose  ester  (acetate,  nitrate,  or mixed  ester)  or glass‐fiber filters  meet  these 
requirements and are commonly available. Other filters with reasonably high collection 
efficiency may be used if required for special applications or assay methods. Selection of a 
filter type generally involves compromises between filter efficiency, flow resistance, and 
requirements imposed by the desired assay metho d. 
 
The specifications of a filter medium often include pore size and filter efficiency. Pore size is 
determined by  filtration of a liquid; the particle size at which the collection efficiency  is 95% in 
water is given as the effective pore size. Filtration efficiency for particles in air, however, is 
dramatically different. Aerodynamic effects make the collection efficiency dependent on the 
face velocity through the filter. Airborne particles of aerodynamic size equal to the pore‐size 
rating  of a filter  are usually collected  with  high  efficiency  (>99%).  Smaller  particles  may  also be 
collected efficiently; however, some sizes may substantially penetrate the filter. Particles in 
the range 0.1‐ to 1.0 micron diameter are most likely to penetrate a fil ter. Many 
manufacturers use dioctylphthalate (DOP) to produce an aerosol of particles 0.3 micron in 
diameter for testing filter efficiency. Thus, if a filter is rated for efficiency by DOP retention, 
collection  of other  particle  sizes  will be more  efficient.  Collection  efficiency  is also increased  by 
higher flow rate for particles >0.1 micron.  
 
Cellulose ester membrane filters have interconnecting pores of uniform size. They typically produce  a higher  resistance  to flow  than  glass‐fiber filters  and collect  most  particles  near  the 
surface of the filter.  
 
Glass‐fiber filters are made of a mat of randomly oriented glass fibers. They have lower flow 
resistance  than  most  membrane  filters,  but trap an appreciable  fraction  of the particles  within 
the filter mat. This interferes with detection of alpha radiation from the filter.  
 
Cellulose filters are often used for air sampling. They have moderate flow resistance, but 
relatively poor collection efficiency. Their use may be justified in some situations, but only 
with the recognition that efficiency for certain particle sizes may be  low. Generally, if 
analytical and sample‐handling requirements  allow,  glass‐fiber or cellulose‐ester  membrane 
filters are a better choice than cellulose filters.  
 
Each type of filter has inherent advantages and disadvantages. The higher flow resistance of 
membrane filters may overtax the capabilities of older models of some PAS pumps although membrane  filters  can be used  successfully  with  many  of the new  models  of pumps.  Glass‐fiber 
filters should be substituted if a significant pressure drop occurs with the sampler being 
utilized.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
74  
 The surface‐collection properties of membrane filters can be an advantage when sampling for 
alpha and weak beta‐emitting materials. Deposition of particles on the surface minimizes 
energy absorption by the filter medium. This is especially important for alpha spectrometry, 
where  the energy  spectrum  is substantially  degraded.  Membrane  filters  are also advantageous 
if the assay procedure involves ashing or dissolution of the filters, but they are relatively 
fragile.  
 
4.1.5.3  Filter Holders  
 
Criteria for filter holders  are simple,  but critical.  For the collection  of large‐volume  air samples, 
filter holders should  be open‐face such that  sample  air is drawn directly onto the  filter surface 
from the atmosphere without passing through a tube, orifice, or other obstruction. This 
precludes loss of  the radionuclide to  surfaces upstream  from the filter. The holder should  face 
downward to avoid collection of large, non‐inhalable particles, unless a different position is 
required. Closed‐face cassettes are recommended for small PAS, to protect the filter from 
direct contamination. Research studies of commonly‐available types of closed‐face cassett es 
with 4‐mm inlets indicate that these designs have good particle‐collection characteristics (at a flow rate of 2 L min
‐1) and reduce sample contamination problems. Other closed‐face filter 
inlet diameters, geometries, and flow rates may also be acceptable, but have not been characterized.  
 
The filter should  receive  adequate  support  so that it is not stretched  or torn  by the  pressure 
drop  caused  by the flow  of sample  air. The  filter holder should  be free of air leakage  around 
the filter as  well as into or  through the holder’s component parts. Metallic  filter holders are 
generally more reliable and durable than plastics. Finally, filter‐changing and holder replacement should be convenient and positive.  
 
4.1.5.4  Size‐Selective  Devices  
 
Size‐selective devices  fall into two categories:  respirable‐fraction  samplers  and instruments  for 
measuring particle‐size distributions. A respirable‐fraction sampler collects a range of particle 
sizes, with collection efficiency decreasing for larger particle sizes. Particles that penetrate the 
size‐selector represent those that would deposit in the pulmonary region of the lungs. A 
particle‐size distribution instrument collects all particles with classification of particle size.  
Size‐distribution  data  can be used  to calculate  the expected  deposition  of particles  throughout 
the respiratory tract.  
 
Particle‐Sizing Devices. Particle‐size distribution measuring devices are typically more  
complex  and require  more  sample  analysis  than  a size‐selective  sampler.  The major  advantage 
in using these devices is that the size distribution of airborne contaminants is useful for 
estimating regional deposition of inhaled particles in the respiratory tract. This information is 
more accurate than that provided by a simple size‐selective sampler, especially if a large part 
of the airborne material has particle size less than about 2 µm. Particle‐size measurement  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
75  
 should be performed only by properly trained individuals, as an investigative tool for 
evaluating  the health  hazard  posed  by a process  or procedure  suspected  of generating 
airborne contamination.  
 
The cascade impactor is the most commonly available particle‐sizing device. Aerosol passing through  a cascade  impactor  is forced  through  a series  of increasingly  rapid  changes  of velocity. 
The inertia of the particles causes them to deviate from the direction of the airstream at 
locations where the particle speed and direction are changing most rapidly. Particles of 
different aerodynamic size deflect to different extents so that la rger particles contact the 
surface of the collection stage. The quantity of m aterial deposited on each stage is measured 
and the size distribution calculated for the sampled aerosol.  
 
There are some  drawbacks  to the use of impactors.  Cascade  impactors  subdivide  the sample 
so that more sensitive assay methods may be required for successful use. There is a limit to 
the mass of material that can be collected on each stage before overloading; inactive dust 
particles contribute to this mass, but not to the analyte. Each stage of the impactor is a separate fraction of the sample which must be analyzed. This multiplies sample number‐ 
capacity  requirements  of the activity  measurement  system.  Careful calibration  of a precisely 
controlled airflow rate is required for accurate particle‐size measurement.  
 
Optical particle‐sizing instruments, such as a laser particle‐size spectrometer, have the 
advantage  of giving  practically  real time  information.  Most  of these instruments  give only  an 
optical particle size, however, which must be converted to an aerodynamic size to be useful 
for dose estimation. They are generally expensive tools used mostly for research.  
 
Respirable‐Fraction Samplers. A number of respirable‐fraction samplers have been  
developed,  but the cyclone  separator is the most  widely  used  and best  characterized  type.  The 
cyclone is specified by NIOSH and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) for personal 
respirable‐mass sampling in coal mines. NIOSH and MSHA currently certify entire sampling 
systems (PAS pump, cyclone, filter head, and filters) for personal respirable‐fraction sampling. 
This "system" approach may be modified as the result of recent research; however, it does 
provide  an interim  standard  for performance. The  performance  of cyclones,  pumps,  and filters 
may be characterized to allow intermixing of sampling‐train components in future work; at 
present, however, theoretical prediction of performance of mixed systems is not reliable.  
 
Cyclones are aerodynamic particle sizers, as are impactors, but have some different operating 
features.  They  are not affected  by loading,  so dusty  environments  are not a problem,  although 
filter loading may limit sampling time. Cyclones are rated for performance at a particular flow 
rate.  Performance  at other flow  rates  cannot  easily  be predicted  and should  be determined  by 
testing.  In contrast,  impactors do follow  a simple,  well‐defined  relation  between  flow  rate and 
size separation.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
76  
 Alternatives to mechanical methods of particle‐sizing exist and other respirable‐fraction 
separators  may  be available  in the future.  Combined  total  and respirable‐fraction  samplers 
would  be desirable;  such  designs  retain  both  the respirable  and non‐respirable  fractions  so 
that total airborne activity can be estimated.  
 
4.1.6 Sample  Activity  Measurement  
 
Most sample analyses at uranium facilities are performed by quantifying the radioactivity by 
counting the samples collected. Some fluorometric analyses are performed with equivalent 
sensitivity.  Kinetic  phosphorescence  analysis  is available  with  substantially  greater  sensitivity.  
 
Alpha  Counting.  Alpha  particles  can be counted  with  ionization,  proportional,  scintillation,  or 
other  solid  state detectors.  The major  drawback  is that relatively  little  particle  penetration,  in 
the filter or in the dust loading, can result in a low reading caused by self‐absorption of the 
alpha particles.  
 
Alpha  Spectrometry.  Measurement of the energy  spectrum  of alpha‐emitters  on a filter  paper 
is possible and very beneficial in some applications in identifying or verifying the identity of 
the isotopes present.  Typically,  semiconductor  detectors  are the choice,  and membrane  filters 
or other surface‐collecting filters are used with very low dust loading.  
 
Beta  Counting.  Thin‐window  GM,  ionization,  proportional,  and solid  state  detectors  are used 
for beta counting. Because of the wide range of beta‐particle energies of even a "single energy" emitter, careful energy calibration is necessary. Beta counting results are less 
dependent on self‐absorption effects.  
 
Beta  Spectrometry.  Beta  spectrometry  has recently  become  feasible  through  developments  in 
tissue‐equivalent plastic detectors. For routine isotopic identification, this method is not as useful, but it may provide valuable shielding information, etc.  
 
Gamma  Spectrometry.  Sodium  Iodide  (NaI)  and High Purity  Germanium  (HPGe)  detectors  can 
provide essential isotopic identification of gamma‐emitters.  
 
Precautions. The intricacies and procedures of sample analysis are beyond the scope of this 
manual. However, a few general precautions are important to mention. The naturally 
occurring radionuclides, radon and thoron and their decay products, are present in all 
atmospheres in widely varying concentrations. Th ese radionuclides are typically present in 
higher concentrations than the isotopes of interest, and tend to interfere with radiometric 
analysis,  unless  the short‐lived  progeny  are given  time  to decay  after sample  collection.  Radon 
progeny, which are much m ore abundant than thoron progeny in most areas, decay with an 
effective half‐life of about 30 minutes and a counting delay of 3 hours may be adequate.  
Thoron  progeny  decay  with  an effective  half‐life  of 10.6 hours,  and where  they  exist in DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
77  
 significant  concentrations,  a counting delay  of several days  is advisable.  The presence  of either 
radionuclide on a filter can be detected by recounting two or three times at intervals of a few 
hours.  
 
The sensitivity  of any counting method  depends  primarily  on the background  count  rate of the 
counting instrument; estimates of low radionuclide concentrations can be seriously in error if 
the counting background is not accurately known. Even in stable instruments for which the 
background count may be quite constant, a daily check is advisable because of the possibility 
of contamination  from  sample  material.  Background  counts  should  be made  with  a blank  filter 
in place because some filter media contain trace  amounts of radioactivity.  
 
Counting instruments  also require  periodic  standardization.  Standard  sources  used  for this 
purpose should match the samples both in size and energy.  
 
The active (upstream) sides of filters collected in clean atmospheres can be difficult to 
identify. Some convention should be followed by sampling personnel to ensure that the 
proper  sides  of filters  will be counted.  This may  consist  of marking  one side of the filter or 
placing the filter in the sample holder consistently with the exposed side toward the identifying number or label on the holder.  
 
4.1.7 Continuous  Air Monitors  (CAM)  
 
The combination of an air sampler and an activity counter into a single device for automatic 
operation and alarm control constitutes a CAM.  Modern CAMs include the ability to 
automatically  change  the filter media,  perform  spectral  analysis  for isotopic  identification,  and 
to distinguish radon/radon progeny.  They can evaluate the airborne contamination levels 
against several DACs simultaneously.  CAMs have local visual and audible alarms and most 
have the ability to provide remote alarm signals to a control room.  Some CAMs have the 
ability to use a remote head which allows for the sampling head to be close to the workers 
breathing zone.  Other CAMs use stack monitoring attachments to sample stack  
airflows.  CAMs  need  to be calibrated  periodically  and routinely  source  checked  to verify  their 
operability.  
 
4.1.8 Monitoring  Strategies  and Protocols  
 
Designing an air‐sampling program for the workplace is a complex task because each facility 
has unique design and operational characteristics. It is important that the radiological control 
personnel who coordinate the sampling program have a thorough understanding of basic facility operations, especially with respect to the potential eac h operation has for generating 
airborne material. In addition, these personnel should be familiar with the working habits of potentially‐exposed workers. The success of most sampling programs depends on the ability of radiological control  personnel  to accu rately  assess worker  exposure  risk and properly  select  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
78  
 workers  for personal  air sampling.  This can only  be accomplished  by well‐trained,  observant 
safety personnel.  
 
The following  questions  should  be considered  for an airborne  activity  hazard  evaluation:  
 
a. Where are the potential  aerosol  generation  and release  locations  in the work‐site,  and 
what is the magnitude of potential exposures associated with each?  
 
b. How  effective  or failure‐prone  are the physical  and procedural  barriers  that protect  the 
worker from airborne radioactive material generated at these locations?  
 
4.1.8.1  Potential  Sources  of Airborne  Contamination  
 
Virtually  every  work  site has at least  one of the fundamental  mechanisms  for the generation 
and suspension of particulate material. The following descriptions of some of the basic 
mechanisms  of aerosol  generation  are intended  to help  radiation  safety  personnel  recognize 
processes which have inherently higher risk:  
 
a. Mechanical fragmentation,  i.e., grinding,  abrasive  saws,  sandblasting;  
 
b. Combustion,  burning materials  producing smoke,  fumes,  etc.; 
 
c. Heating  ‐ many  materials  produce  aerosols  when  heated,  without  actually  igniting ; 
 
d. Formation  from  bubbles,  foams,  or highly  agitated  liquids  ‐ fine solid  aerosol  particles 
can form from larger, evaporating liquid droplets ; 
 
e. Condensation  of liquid  or solid  particles  from  the gas phase ; 
 
f. Formation  of particles  from  the products  of gas‐phase  reactions,  e.g.,  UF 6 + 2 H2O → 
UO 2F2 + 4 HF; 
 
g. Formation  of solid,  radioactive  nuclides  from  gaseous  parent  nuclides  ‐ these 
radionuclides usually attach to existing, nonradioactive aerosol particles ; 
 
h. Adsorption  of gaseous,  radioactive  nuclides  on non‐radioactive  aerosols . 
 
The program designer should be familiar with the routines and working habits of workers, 
especially those in situations where there is a greater potential for generating locally high 
concentrations  of airborne  contamination.  This will assist  in planning for exposure  prevention 
and in selecting suitable sampling methods. Some factors to consider are the following:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
79  
 a. Worker location and mobility ‐ If the worker stays in a fixed location, fixed breathing‐ 
zone sampling may be useful for individual exposure estimation. This sampling may be 
performed using moderate flow‐rate pumps (30 to 90 L min‐1) which can be located 
within  a few feet of the worker.  Mobile  workers  should  be surveyed  using PAS to obtain 
a breathing‐zone sample.  
 
b. Direct  versus  remote  handling of radioactive  material ‐ Remote‐handling facilities  such 
as hot cells or caves usually restrict the workers to a fixed location. Well‐located fixed 
sampling heads may be adequate for breathing‐zone sampling at these work areas, 
provided that they have been properly located. As previously noted in this section, 
determining the proper sampling points for fixed breathing‐zone sampling at fume 
hoods, glove boxes, etc., is not a straightforward exercise, and PAS may be the most expedient means for sampling a work er’s true breathing zone.  
 
Direct‐handling is commonly performed on material with relatively low intrinsic hazard, e.g.,  uranium  metal  or compounds.  This sort of material may  be moved  around  the work 
site and directly manipulated at a number of locations. Fixed breathing‐zone samplers 
usually will be unsatisfactory in these situations, and PASs would be required for 
estimating an individual worker’s exposure in DAC‐hours.  
 
c. Material  with  high  intrinsic  hazard  is usually  well contained,  but if it is moved  over  wide 
areas  in process flows,  there is a potential for release at  any point. The effectiveness  of 
containment, in the process flow at locations where workers have access, is a major 
factor when considering use of PASs.  
 
When  evaluating  risks  associated  with  direct  handling of radioactive  materials,  the variation  in 
techniques  employed  by different workers  to perform  the same task  must  also be considered. 
No two workers perform the same operation in exactly the same manner. Aerosol production may depend on how each individual performs the operation (e.g., rate, accuracy, operating 
temperatures).  
 
4.1.8.2  Characterization  of Controls  
 
For evaluating  work‐place  controls,  work  sites  can be characterized  as either "tightly  
controlled"  or "loosely  controlled."  Tightly  controlled  work  areas  are preferred  in all cases, 
but there are situations where good control is difficult or not reasonably achievable. PAS  
monitoring  can help  define  those  operations  that pose  the greatest  radiological  control 
problems and thus facilitate decisions to improve specific work situations.  
 
Significant  exposure incidents  in highly  controlled  (i.e.,  tightly  controlled)  areas  usually  are the 
result of isolated and unforeseeable events, which are complete departures from the normal 
material‐processing routine. These events usually include loss of containment. In tightly 
controlled areas, PASs can serve as a means of detecting a failure of c ontainment because  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
80  
 work  locations  may  be located  near  potential  release  points,  and inadequate  physical  controls 
may be apparent only during an operation performed by a worker.  
 
4.2 Surface  Contamination Control  
 
Uranium contamination on plant surfaces, such as floors and walls, does not present a 
significant risk to personnel unless the uranium becomes airborne by resuspension and is 
inhaled. The probability of significant airborne concentrations resulting from re suspension of 
uranium as a result of normal activities (such as walking) is low; however, any activity that 
vigorously  disturbs the  surface (such as  floor  sweeping)  increases the  probability of significant 
airborne concentrations of uranium. Resuspension i s a function of both the chemical and 
physical forms of the uranium contamination. External exposure hazards from surface 
contamination can become an important concern when uranium decay products and/or 
fission  products  accumulate  on surfaces.  In some  instances,  efforts  to decontaminate  uranium 
compounds may leave behind insoluble uranium and decay product compounds which could 
present an external exposure hazard. Good industrial housekeeping practices and normal 
standards of personal hygiene will usually e nsure that uranium surface contamination does 
not present a significant exposure hazard. However, even if the probability of resuspension is 
low, surface contamination on floors can result in contamination of shoes and thereby result 
in the potential  for tracking  of contamination  into uncontrolled  areas.  Thus, contamination  on 
surfaces must also be adequately controlled to prevent transfer of contamination above 
acceptable levels.  
 
Several other  contamination  control  objectives  can be accomplished  by a program  of 
monitoring and control of surface contamination:  
 
a. The program  can be designed  to provide  information  to detect containment  failures 
or departures from good operating practices ; 
 
b. It can provide  information  that will assist  in the design  and evaluation  of personnel 
monitoring, bioassay, and air monitoring programs ; 
 
c. The contamination monitoring and control program will provide information to establish  operating zones,  guidelines  and constraints  for radiation  protection,  and 
operational procedures ; 
 
d. The program  will provide  practical assurance  that uranium  contamination  is confined 
to the operating areas of the plant and that the potential is minimized for contamination of personnel, the environment, and sensitive analytical areas.  
 
Contamination  control  of work  surfaces  such  as tools,  equipment  to be worked  on (e.g., 
disassembly, machining), desks or tables in process areas is of greater concern than  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
81  
 contamination on floors. The likelihood of personnel contamination, ingestion of material 
through  hand  contamination,  or inhalation  of resuspended  uranium  compounds  through  work 
activities represents a significant potential for exposure of personnel. Work activities that involve the destruction of surfaces such as grinding, machining, drilling, or cutting can 
generate significant levels of airborne uranium compounds. Operatio ns such as welding, 
burning,  heating,  etc. can alter  the physical  and/or  chemical  state  of uranium  compounds  that 
are on the surfaces of equipment. Job‐specific monitoring is  required to establish protection 
requirements as a function of surface contamination levels.  
 
4.2.1 Reporting  and Documenting  Contamination Levels  
 
Radiological control programs require the performance of contamination surveys to 
determine existing  conditions  in a given location.  Maps  with  sufficient  detail to permit 
identification of original survey locations should be maintained. Records shall contain 
sufficient detail to be meaningful even after the originator is no longer available.  
Contamination  surveys  should  be recorded  on appropriate  standard  forms  and include  the 
following common elements:  
 
a. Date,  time,  and purpose  of the survey ; 
 
b. General and specific  location  of the survey ; 
 
c. Name  and signature  of the surveyor  and analyst ; 
 
d. Pertinent information  needed  to interpret  the survey  results ; 
 
e. Reference to a specific  radiological  work  permit  if the survey  is performed  to support 
the permit.  
 
In addition,  records  of contamination  surveys  should  include,  at a minimum,  the following 
information:  
 
a. Model  and serial number  or other  unique  identifier  of counting equipment ; 
 
b. Contamination levels (using appropriate units) and appropriate supporting 
parameters,  including counting efficiency,  counting time,  correction  factors,  type  of 
radiation, and whether the contamination was fixed or removable ; 
 
c. Location  of areas  found  to contain  hot particles  or high  concentrations  of localized 
contamination ; 
 
d. Follow‐up  survey  results  for decontamination  processes  cross‐referenced  to the 
original survey . DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
82  
  
Records for the release of material and equipment from radiological areas to controlled areas 
should describe the property, the date on which the release survey was performed, the 
identity  of the individual  who  performed  the survey,  the type  and identification  number  of the 
survey instrument used, and the results of the survey. Additional details on radiation records 
can be obtained from DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 
(2017b ). 
 
All skin and personal  property  contaminations  should  be documented  and evaluated  to help 
improve the contamination control program. Documentation should include the following:  
 
a. The person’s  name  and work  group;  
 
b. The location,  amount,  and type  of skin or personal  property  contamination ; 
 
c. The results  of decontamination;  
 
d. A description of circumstances involved in the occurrence, such as radiation work 
permit  number,  protective clothing required,  and protective clothing actually  
used . 
 
4.2.2 Monitoring  
 
Radiological workers  are often  assigned  tasks  that could  expose  them  to radioactive  material. 
It is not sufficient to rely exclusively on equipment design to minimize contamination and 
exposure in the work place. A radiation protection program shall include both monitoring of 
the workers (discussed in Section 4.3) and monitoring of the co nditions in the workplace (10 
CFR § 835.401 ‐ § 835.403, § 835.1101‐ § 835.1102). Both functions are essential to a good radiation monitoring program.  
 
Continuous monitoring should be provided during the periods of high or unusual risk associated with the work in the area. Periods of high or unusual risk include the potential or 
actual breaching of the integrity of the glovebox or associated systems, including such 
maintenance as replacement of panels, glove changes, bag‐out operations, replacement of 
filters, or repair of vacuum systems. Work that involves the use of temporary enclosures 
(greenhouses)  should  be provided  with  continuous  coverage  by an RCT.  For decommissioning, 
most activities will be new, unique, and have no historical precedent. Consequently, high and 
unusual risks may become the norm and the use of temporary controls and continuous 
coverage the routine.  
 
Monitoring of the workplace is an essential element of every routine surveillance program. It 
can be effectively accomplished using any or all of the techniques that are discussed in this 
section.  The rigor  with  which  all of the various  elements  of a radiation  monitoring  program  are DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
83  
 applied should be tailored to meet the needs of the individual work areas and depend on the  
kind and quantity of radioactive material present and its potential for dispersion. Each 
program should be designed to meet existing needs, but also should be flexible to allow for 
incorporation  of the possible  advantages  to be provided  by the various  available  monitoring 
practices. Monitoring practices include, but are not limited, to the following:  
 
a. Contamination  surveys  of the workplace ; 
 
b. Release  surveys ; 
 
c. External  exposure surveys ; 
 
d. Airborne  contamination  surveys ; 
 
e. Routine  surveillance  by an RCT. 
 
4.2.2.1  Contamination  Surveys  of the Workplace  
 
The radiation monitoring program should include documented survey procedures, a system 
for maintaining survey results, and contamination control limits for "fixed" and "removable" 
contamination. The results of contamination surveys should be reported in ac tivity per area 
(e.g.,  dpm/100  cm2) except  for large‐area swipes  and swipes  of very  small items.  This permits 
interpretation of the recorded data without requiring knowledge of instrument efficiency or geometry.  
 
All workplaces  should  be monitored  for contamination  levels  on a regularly  scheduled  basis. 
The frequency  of such  surveys  will depend  on the potential for dispersion  of the radioactive 
material. As a minimum, all gloves, work surfaces, floors, equipment, etc., within the 
workplace should be surveyed according to the frequencies listed in DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 
(2017b ). 
 
The change room and other support facilities within the controlled area should be surveyed 
for contamination daily. Continuous air monitors, survey instruments at step‐off pads, and 
hand  and shoe  counters  should  be functionally  tested  daily  or once  per shift  in support  of the 
weekly and monthly surveys.  
 
These frequent surveys are also part of the routine surveillance program and permit immediate follow‐up if low‐level contamination is detected to minimize the potential for 
major incidents. Some fixtures and support areas outside the controlled area, such as 
doorknobs and telephones of adjacent offices and the lunchroom, should als o be surveyed 
daily. Other support areas should be surveyed monthly. If routine survey results detect any 
contamination  in a given  area,  more  detailed  surveys  should  be performed  to determine  the 
extent and source of the contamination.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
84  
 Two  principles  should  be adopted  to preclude  the possibility  that contaminated  waste  would 
be disposed of as ordinary waste: 1) all process and controlled area waste should be 
considered  contaminated,  and 2) mechanisms  should  be established  that prevent  the mixing 
of contaminated and non‐contaminated waste. In addition, mixing radioactive waste with 
RCRA‐regulated hazardous waste should be avoided.  
 
4.2.2.2  Release  Surveys  
 
As stated in Section 2.1.4.1., transuranics exist in small quantities of recycled or reclaimed 
feed materials.  In many  instances, these isotopes may  be limiting for  release  of materials.  For 
transuranic and uranium radionuclides, the contamination level (fixed and removable) at which  surfaces  are considered  contaminated  are listed  in Appendix  D of 10 CFR Part 835.  That 
document also specifies the criteria for the release of materials and equipment from 
radiological areas to controlled areas.  
 
Detailed  requirements  for unrestricted  release  of materials  and equipment  from  controlled 
areas are found in DOE Order 458.1  Chg 4 , Radiation Protection of the Public and Environment 
(2020a ). 
 
4.2.2.3  External  Exposure  Surveys  
 
To delineate  the levels  involved,  measurements  of external  exposure  should  be made  at the 
time a program is established at all locations where personnel exposure occurs. Additional 
photon and neutron measurements should be made at the same frequency as the 
contamination surveys. The buildup of contamination in glove boxes and on gloves and 
equipment may contribute substantially to  the external dose rates.  
 
4.2.2.4  Measurement and Survey  Techniques  
 
This section discusses four types of contamination surveys that are typically used in DOE 
facilities.  Surveys  for removable  contamination  include  a large‐area wipe  survey  and a swipe 
or smear survey. Surveys for total/fixed contamination include a scan survey and a 
statistically‐based survey. These surveys, or a combination of them, are used to survey 
material for release from radiological control. The appropriate use of each typ e of survey is 
discussed.  
 
Surveys  for Removable  Contamination  
 
Two  types  of surveys  are used  for removable  contamination:  a large‐area  wipe  survey  and a 
swipe or smear survey.  
 
A large‐area wipe survey is used to qualitatively detect gross removable  contamination.  A 
large‐area wipe  survey  is typically  performed  using a large  floor cloth  and a dust  mop  type DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
85  
 handle to wipe large areas. This technique tends to concentrate any low levels of removable 
contamination that may be present. The surface to be wiped and the wiping material should 
be industrially clean (e.g., free of debris, grease) to reduce self‐absorption of alpha 
contamination.  The survey  is performed  by wiping the surface  of the area  being surveyed  and 
conducting frequent checks of the cloth using a portable instrument. For detection of alpha‐ 
emitting  isotopes,  a nonabsorbent  material should  be used.  Removable  contamination  will be 
accumulated and concentrated on the wipe, increasing the probability of its detection.  
Checking for contamination is conducted by placing an alpha‐measurement instrument 
approximately  0.25  in. (0.6 cm) from  the surface  of the wipe  for 5 seconds,  and the count  rate 
observed. If no radioactivity above background is measured, then the material is not 
contaminated  with removable contamination. If radioactivity above background is measured, 
the material is contaminated. Technical smears (i.e. 100 cm2) need to be taken to quantify 
removable contamination levels. Depending upon the specific circumstances, a series of 
smears may be required to locate and quantify the contamination within the area covered by 
the large‐area wipe. In most instances, if cont amination is detected on the large‐area wipe, 
decontamination should be considered.  
 
For transuranic radionuclides, the guideline values for removable contamination are lower 
than the minimum detectable activity (MDA) of portable instruments. During a wipe survey, 
the surface area of the material must be large enough that the quantity of r adioactivity 
collected on the wipe will be greater than the MDA of the instrument. Wipe surveys of areas 
smaller than this minimum surface area require more sophisticated measuring instruments, 
such as a scaler measurement, and the entire surface of the material should be wiped. The minimum  area  for using  a large‐area wipe  survey  is given  by where  GV is the guideline  value  of 
the potential contaminant, given in Table 4‐1.  
 
 
Amin  MDA  = Gvremovable   
x 100  cm2; 
 
Where:  
Amin is the minimum  area  for using a large‐area wiper  survey, 
GV removable  is the guideline  value  of the potential  contaminant 
MDA is the minimum detectable activity.  
 
The purpose of a smear survey is to locate and quantify removable contamination that is known or suspected to exist. For small items, a smear may be used at any time to verify the item’s contamination status. A smear or swipe survey is performed by wiping a cloth, paper, 
plastic foam, or fiberglass disk over a 100‐cm
2 area of the surface. The swipe should be taken 
with a dry medium using moderate pressure except for tritium. A common field practice is to 
use two fingers  to press  the swipe  medium  against  the surface  to be swiped.  The swipe  is then 
moved along an "S" shaped path that has a nomin al length of 8 in. (20 cm) to 10 in. (25 cm).  
When  the potential  contaminant  emits  alpha  radiation,  paper  or fiberglass  filter papers  should DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
86  
 be used so that alpha activity is not attenuated by becoming imbedded in the wipe. If the 
contaminant is an alpha‐emitter and the surface is wet, the smear should be dried before counting.  To improve the detection limit, smears may be taken over areas larger than 100 
cm
2. However,  the size of the area smeared  should be limited  to prevent  buildup of material 
(radioactive  or otherwise) that would  attenuate alpha  radiation. The current  practice  at DOE 
facilities is to use the 100 cm2 area as the minimum size of objects being smeared.  
Appropriate  corrections  should  be made  for objects  smaller than  100 cm2 
If contamination is detected during a scan survey for fixed contamination, a swipe survey for removable  contamination  should  be performed  to determine  if the contamination  is fixed  and 
to quantify any removable contamination. If no contamination above the guideline values for removable  contamination  in Table  4‐1 is detected  during the smear  survey,  the contamination 
is fixed, and the area should be posted appropriately.  
 
A smear survey  may  be used  routinely  to detect removable  contamination,  especially  for 
contamination surveys of radiological areas.  . DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

1 The values in this table, with the exception noted in footnote 6  below, apply to radioactive contamination deposited on, but 
not incorporated  into the interior  or matrix  of, the contaminated  item.  Where  surface contamination  by both alpha‐  and beta‐ 
gamma‐emitting nuclides exists, the limits established for alpha‐ and beta‐gamma‐emitting nuclides apply independently.  
2 As used in this table,  dpm  (disintegrations  per minute)  means  the rate of emission  by radioactive  material  as determined  by 
correcting the counts per minute observed by an appropriate detector for background, efficiency, and geometric factors 
associated with the instrumentation.  
3 The levels may  be averaged  over  one square meter  provided the maximum surface activity  in any area  of 100 cm2 is less than 
three times the value specified.  For purposes of averaging, any square meter of surface shall be considered to be above the 
surface contamination value if: (1) from measurements of a representative number of sections it is determined that the 
average contamination level exceeds the applic able value; or (2) it is determined that the sum of the activity of all isolated 
spots or particle s in any 100 cm2 area exceeds three times the applicable value.  
4 The amount of removable radioactive material per 100 cm2 of surface area should be determined by swiping the area with 
dry filter or soft absorbent paper, applying moderate pressure, and then assessing the amount of radioactive material on the swipe with  an appropriate instrument  of known efficiency.  (Note ‐ The use of dry material  may  not be appropriate  for tritium.) 
When removable contamination on objects of surface area less than 100 cm
2 is determined, the activity per unit area shall be 
based on the actual area and the entire surface shall be wiped.  It is no t necessary to use swiping techniques to measure 
removable contamination levels if direct scan surveys indicate that the total residual surface contamination levels are withi n 
the limits for removable contamination.  
5 This category  of radionuclides  includes  mixed  fission  products,  including  the Sr‐90  which is present  in them.  It does  not apply 
to Sr‐90 which has been separated from the other fission products or mixtures where the Sr‐90 has been enriched.  
6 Tritium  contamination  may  diffuse into the volume  or matrix  of materials. Evaluation  of surface contamination  shall  consider 
the extent to which such contamination may migrate to the surface in order to ensure the surface contamination value 
provided in this appendix is not exceeded.  Once this contamination migrates to the surface, it may be removable, not fixed; 
therefore, a "Total" value does not apply.  In certain cases, a “Total” value of 10,000 dpm/100 cm2 may be applicable either to 
metals of the types from which insoluble special tritium compounds are formed, that have been exposed to tritium, or to bulk materials to which insoluble special tritium compound particles are fixed to a surface.  
7 These  limits  apply  only  to the alpha  emitters  within the respective  decay  series.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
88  
 Scan Survey  for Fixed  Contamination  
 
A scan survey for fixed contamination requires passing a detector attached to a portable 
instrument  over  the surface  of the area  being  surveyed  at a fixed,  known  scan  speed  and at a 
specified distance from the surface. Typically, the scan speed is 2 in./s (5 cm/s) and the 
maximum distance is 0.25 in. (0.6 cm) for alpha‐contamination instruments. A scan survey 
should be used to survey material that resides in an area controlled for contamination 
purposes, an area  where unsealed radioactive sources are used, or an area surrounding an 
area controlled for contamination purposes.  
 
During the performance  of scan  surveys,  the audible  response  of the instrument  is faster than 
the needle deflection. Therefore, audible response should be used in conjunction with meter 
readings. For alpha surveys, the surveyor should pause for 3 to 5 seconds each time an 
individual pulse is detected in order to allow a longer count time at th e location of the 
detected pulse, until it is determined whether the response indicates random background 
noise or detected contamination . 
 
The most critical factor affecting a scan survey measurement is the speed at which scan 
surveys  are performed.  Counting time  is inversely  proportional  to scan  speed.  For instruments 
with larger detector faces, the scan speed is faster for a given rate of meter movement because a point on the surveyed surface remains beneath the window longer. To ensure that 
low levels of contamination can be detected, it is necessary that a maximum scan speed be 
mandated and that this speed be implemented during field measurements. Empirical information is available indicating that, for most instruments in current use, a maximum scan 
speed of 2 in./s (5 cm/s) can detect contamina tion at or above the total contamination  values 
specified in Table 4.1 for nearly all radionuclides with 67% confidence.  
 
For a rectangular probe,  the detection  probability  can be increased  by moving  the probe 
lengthwise.  
 
4.2.3 Release Criteria  
 
Material in contamination, high contamination, or airborne radioactivity areas, shall be treated  as radioactive  material and shall not be released  to controlled  areas  if either  of the 
following conditions exist:  
 
a. Measurements  of accessible  surfaces  show  that either  the total  or removable 
contamination levels exceed the values specified in Table 4‐1.  
 
b. Prior use suggests  that the contamination  levels  on the inaccessible  surfaces  are likely 
to exceed the values specified in Table 4‐1 (10 CFR § 835.1101).  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
89  
 Usually,  an ALARA  evaluation  is needed  to ensure  the contamination  levels  cannot  be 
reduced  even  further  below  the DOE  Order  458.1 release  limits  for a reasonable  cost.  
 
Material that has never been in a contaminated or airborne radioactivity area may be 
removed to controlled areas without survey. If the history of the item is unknown, it is appropriate  to assume  that it may  have  been  in a contaminated  or airborne  radioactivity  area.  
 
To release material from radiological control, a methodology has been developed to reduce the time 
required to perform a survey while meeting DOE requirements. A logic diagram of the protocol  is 
shown  in Figure  4‐1. The methodology  ensures,  with  67% confidence, that  the guideline values of 
DOE Order 458.1 and 10 CFR Part 835 are met. The most current preapproved authorized limits for 
support of DOE Order 458.1 are listed in DOE ‐STD‐1241 ‐2023, Implementing Release and Clearance 
of Property Requirements  (2023) . DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
90  
 Figure  4‐1. Protocol  for Release of Materials  from  Radiological  Control  
 
 
The material release methodology has four main components: material evaluation, scan 
survey for fixed contamination, large‐area wipe survey for removable contamination 
(described above) followed by technical smears as necessary, and statistical survey for fixed contamination.  The material evaluation  process  involves  consideration  of the previous  known 
uses of the material, as well as typical uses and the environment in which the material was used. Material evaluation places the material into one of two categories: not potentially 
contaminated or potentially contaminated.  
 
Non‐radioactive  material  can be released  without  an instrument  survey  if its documented 
history ensures the following:  
 
a. That  it has never  been  used  or stored  in an area  controlled  for contamination  
DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
91  
 purposes  (i.e.,  a contamination  area,  high  contamination  area,  or airborne 
radioactivity area).  
 
b. That  it has never  come  into contact  with  unsealed  radioactive  sources.  
 
c. That  it has not been  stored  or used  in a radiological buffer area  (RBA) surrounding a 
contamination area, high contamination area, or airborne radioactivity area.  
 
This material may be considered to be not contaminated and an instrument survey is not 
necessary.  A material history  release  form  should  be used  to document  the release  of material 
that is known to be free of contamination by its history of use. If the material history release 
form cannot be completed, or if the history of the material is unknown, an instrument survey 
must be made of the material. Material released  from RBAs around contamination  areas, high 
contamination areas, or airborne radioactivity areas should also be evaluated using an 
instrument survey.  
 
The material evaluation process  should also consider the nuclides to which the material was 
potentially exposed. If the material was exposed to significant quantities of nuclides that are difficult  to detect,  including tritium  
14C, 125I, or 129I, an appropriate  survey  methodology  should 
be applied.  
 
A scan survey for fixed contamination requires passing the detector of an alpha and a 
beta/gamma  survey  instrument,  as applicable,  over  the accessible  surface  of the material.  The 
detector should be moved at a constant rate that allows detection of contamination  at a level 
equal to  three  times  the guideline  value.  If a change in the audible  output of  the instrument  is 
heard, the area under the window of the instrument should be re‐surveyed using a stationary 
measurement for 3 to 5 seconds. If the increase does not persist, the scan should continue. If 
the elevated counts persist, it is good practice to consider the m aterial is contaminated and 
should not be released. This procedure s hould be followed until the surface of the material 
has been surveyed.  
 
The scan survey for fixed contamination ensures that none of the material’s surface is 
contaminated  above  three times  the guideline  value.  If no contamination  above  background  is 
detected during the scan survey, a large‐area wipe survey for removable contamination 
should be performed. If contamination above background is detected, then decontamination 
of the material should  be considered  and the methodology  described  in this document  should 
not be applied.  
 
Following the scan and large‐area wipe surveys, a statistical survey for fixed contamination 
should be performed. The survey methodology should be used for both beta/gamma and alpha  contamination,  unless  only  one type  of potential  contaminant  exists  in the facility.  If no 
measurements above background are observed, the material may be released from  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
92  
 radiological  control.  
 
The fixed  survey  measurements  should  be chosen  using  random  detector  placements  over  the 
entire surface of the material. It may be prudent to bias some of the measurements toward 
those areas that are more likely to be contaminated, including handles, horizontal surfaces, 
stains, cracks, and other surface anomalies in which foreign material typically accumulates.  
This type  of selection  bias will further  increase  the confidence  associated  with  the statistical 
survey method.  
 
Measurements performed to release material should be made in a low‐background area 
unless the MDA of the instrument in a high‐background area is known and appropriate 
considerations are made. If material is being surveyed for release from a radiological area, 
performing  measurements  in a low‐background  area may  not be possible.  If background  count 
rates  are high  enough  that the release  guideline  values  cannot  be measured  in the radiological 
area by using portable survey instruments, a survey for removable contamination should be performed to avoid spreading removable contamination from the radiological area. I f the 
survey for removable contamination does not indicate the presence of contamination in 
excess of background levels, the material may be moved to an area with a lower background 
for an immediate fixed contamination survey.  
 
4.2.3.1  Uranium  Contamination  Detection  
 
The detection and measurement of uranium contamination is necessary to ensure control of 
contamination and compliance with DOE requirements. Typically, detection of uranium 
contamination has been performed using the alpha activity. However, for some condit ions 
and situations,  detection  of the beta/gamma  radiations  from  uranium  decay  products  may  be 
a more sensitive and more appropriate monitoring technique. For natural uranium, depleted uranium, and the lower levels of enriched uranium that are in equilibrium with their decay 
products, the detection sensitivity for the beta/gamma radiations is about five times more 
sensitive than by the detection of the alpha alone. If the uranium is highly enriched or has 
been  very  recently  processed,  detection  using the alpha  radiation  is necessary  because  of the 
high alpha:beta ratio.  
 
Detection of uranium contamination may require use of beta/gamma‐sensitive instruments 
when  surveying upholstery  material,  rugs,  cloth,  and wet surfaces.  Because  of the range  and 
ease of shielding alpha particles, burial or surface liquid may preclude the detection of the 
alpha radiation. The use of GM detectors, such as the thin‐window detector probe, is 
particularly useful in these situations. In some instances, a thin Nal de tector may be better 
than a GM detector for detecting low‐energy photons from ura nium contamination.  
 
Many  of the processes  used  in uranium  facilities  may  separate  and/or  concentrate impurities 
or decay products of uranium. Examples of these processes are uranium recovery from ore, 
reduction of green salt to metal, UF
6 conversion, casting of metal, and uranium oxidation.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
93  
 Radionuclides of particular importance are 234mPa and other decay products and trace 
impurities such as 99Tc, 239Pu, and 231Np. In addition to the separation processes, some of the 
decay products of uranium may be selectively accumulated in tank and pipe liner material. 
Effective dose rates of up to 150 mrem/h, attributed to radium accumulation, have been 
measured  from  neoprene  liner  material.  Dose  rates  from  furnace  lids and crucibles  have  been 
measured as high as 30 rad/h.  
 
Detection  and measurement  of uranium  contamination,  both  surface  and airborne,  require  a 
knowledge of the process and of the separation and concentration mechanisms. Depending 
upon the process, the time since separation, and the isotopic ratios of the uranium, 
contamination resulting from uranium operations may be almost totally alpha or tot ally 
beta/gamma‐emitters. Consequently, detection techniques may require the capability to 
detect  all types  of radiations.  Appropriate  monitoring  in most  facilities  requ ires both  types  of 
surveys, but on differing frequencies.  
 
4.2.4 ALARA  Guidelines  
 
Contamination  levels  should  be maintained  ALARA  to minimize  the potential  for the spread  of 
contamination and to reduce the protective measures and equipment required. Control of radioactive material at the source and prevention of the generation of contamination are 
generally more effective and less costly than remediation.  
 
4.3 Personnel  Contamination Control  
 
Contamination  control  should  be achieved  primarily  by physical  design  features,  including 
engineering controls (see the discussion above), such as containment, confinement, and 
ventilation control. Only if the primary controls fail or if there is a potential for personnel 
contamination during an activity are controls such as protectiv e clothing and respirators 
advisable.  
 
4.3.1 Monitoring  Philosophy  
 
Although the primary hazard to personnel from uranium is from internal exposure, 
contamination  is also of concern  because  of potential  skin doses.  Additionally,  an objective of 
the contamination control program is to confine uranium contamination to production/work 
areas  and to prevent any  spread  of contamination to areas  outside the plant  or to the public. 
Therefore, guidelines for allowable contamination on personnel and personal clothing/shoes both inside the plant and prior to exiting radiological areas  are required. Also, a personnel 
monitoring program  must  be developed  with  adequate  monitoring  equipment  and sensitivity 
to provide assurance that contamination is effectively controlled. The guidelines should be developed considering the following factors:  
 
a. The need  to prevent  detectable  activity  from  appearing  outside  the controlled  area ; DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
94  
  
b. The degree of risk to the health  of the employees,  their  families,  and the public  from 
contamination removed from the plant ; 
 
c. The technical  feasibility  of measurement of the guide  levels ; 
 
d. Commitment to the policy  of keeping  contamination  to the minimum  practical  level ; 
 
e. The presence  of other  radionuclides  due to the presence  of recycled  uranium 
contaminants or uranium daughters . 
 
4.3.2 Monitoring  Program  
 
Instrumentation should be provided and persons in a uranium workstation should be 
required to survey themselves at established frequencies. As a minimum, workers should 
survey  their  gloves  and coverall sleeves  each  time  they  are withdrawn  from  a glove  box (or 
similar containment system) and after each glove replacement or bag‐out operation.  
 
In addition to mandatory monitoring at the exit to areas controlled for contamination, personnel monitoring for contamination should be mandatory at the egress from controlled 
areas and be conducted in a verifiable manner. Portal monitors, hand‐and‐shoe co unters, 
and/or  portable  survey  instruments  may  be used  for this purpose.  If employees  are instructed 
to perform self‐monitoring, the equipment should be set up in a "go/no‐go" mode and 
employees  should  be clearly  instructed  in the required  actions  to take  if predetermined  action 
levels are exceeded. Frequent audits should be performed to verify that controls are 
adequate. Limiting the number of egress points and controlling personnel movement can 
minimize the numbers of locations where positive control of personnel monitori ng must be 
maintained.  
 
Monitoring of shoes, clothing, and hands should be required prior to leaving a workstation 
where uranium or uranium contaminated material was handled. Following routine work, self‐ 
monitoring upon  exit is usually  considered  adequate  if the person  has received  proper  training 
in the use of the instrument provided. The instrument should clearly detect an unacceptable 
level of contamination.  
 
For work that involves a high potential for intake of radioactive material in excess of the 
regulatory  limits,  engineering and administrative  controls  should  be implemented  to eliminate 
this potential.  If these controls are inadequate, then appropriate PPE, including respirators, 
should be implemented.  
 
After  performing  work  that,  in retrospect,  involved  a high  potential  for intake  of radioactive 
material, each worker should provide a swipe of the nasal passages, to be counted  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
95  
 immediately. If respiratory protection was worn, there is no need for nasal swipes unless a 
breach of the respirator seal is suspected. If facial contamination is detected during the exit 
contamination  monitoring,  a nasal swipe  should  be taken  and counted  immediately.  Chapter  5 
provides guidance on the actions to be taken if a nasal swipe is positive.  
 
4.3.3 Protective  Clothing  
 
Various  types  of protective  clothing,  including laboratory  coats,  shoe  covers,  gloves,  coveralls, 
plastic or rubber suits, and air‐purifying or atmosphere‐supplying respiratory protective 
equipment, may be required for operations with transuranic radionuclides. The use of 
company‐issue shoes and clothing for employees with work assignments i n process areas can 
be a major aid in contamination control. Some facilities are using disposable anti‐ 
contamination clothing. This may be a cost savings from a handlin g standpoint. However, 
disposal costs should be considered.  
 
4.3.4 Respiratory  Protection  
 
While every attempt should be made to control uranium hazards utilizing physical design features,  including engineering controls,  the use of respiratory  protection  is an essential  part 
of the radiological control program.  
 
As with personnel protective equipment, respiratory equipment utilized must also provide 
protection from the full range of airborne hazards that may be encountered in the work 
environment. For example, a uranium metal machining operation may have both an airborne 
uranium oxide hazard and an airborne hazard from solvent vapors. The respirator utilized 
must  be effective for both  types  of hazard s. Also,  one airborne  contaminant  may  interfere  
with the effectiveness of the canister in an air‐purifying device that is designed for a different 
contaminant. For example, a corrosive gas, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF), may attack a HEPA 
filter and render the filter ineffective. It is important to coordinate the use of respiratory 
protection requirements with other health protection groups. The respiratory protection 
program should also be in compliance with ANSI Standard Z88.2‐2015, American National 
Standard for Respiratory  Protection  (2015a)  requirements.  In specifying  respirators  for various 
applications, one should always know the applicable protection factors to determine that the 
range of hazard that may be encountered will be covered. While the specification of 
respiratory protection should normally be made a result of personal and/or area sampling 
results,  the use of respirator guides based on surface contamination monitoring results is also 
acceptable.  
 
4.3.5 ALARA  Guidelines  
 
The total dose to an individual and the collective dose to the work force should be ALARA. 
When  applied  to personnel  contamination  or internal intakes,  this generally  means  less‐than‐ 
detectable dose with the best available commercial technology.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
96  
  
4.3.6 Release Criteria  
 
The decision to release personnel with detectable uranium contamination is made on a case‐ 
by‐case basis. If the individual is injured and needs prompt medical attention, medical 
treatment will always take precedence, with compensatory measures made for pr otecting 
medical personnel and facilities. If injuries are absent or do not require immediate attention, 
decontamination  is preferable  to ensure  that the dose  to the contaminated  individual  and the 
potential for inhalation by the victim and medical staff are minimized and the spread of 
contamination is prevented.  
 
In a case  where  decontamination  is incomplete  due to injury  to the skin or other  reasons,  the 
individual may be provisionally released with measures to prevent the spread of 
contamination.  
 
4.4 Decontamination and Decommissioning  Techniques  
 
This section concentrates on decontamination techniques to be used in the final 
decommissioning of a uranium‐contaminated facility for unrestricted release. Some of these 
techniques are similar to those used during routine operations (e.g., personnel decontamination  and some  equipment  and building surface  decontamination).  Contamination 
detection methods are similar for routine and decommissioning operations.  
 
4.4.1 Personnel  Decontamination 
 
Skin decontamination  should  be performed  by health  physics  technicians  or other  members  of 
the health physics staff. The treatment and decontamination of wounds should be performed 
by medical staff.  
 
Non‐abrasive methods should be used for skin decontamination to protect the tissues from 
deeper contamination. Masking tape should be used to remove dry contamination. Wet 
decontamination  should  be used  to remove  residual contamination.  The skin should  be gently 
scrubbed with soap and water. Diluted bleach with water may be applied as needed to 
decontaminate more effectively. The following procedure is recommended:  
 
a. Survey  the worker  to determine  the contaminated  areas  of the skin.  Have  the medical 
staff treat and decontaminate breaks in the skin.  
 
b. Wipe  loose  contamination  with  a gauze  sponge  or cotton  applicators  dipped  in mild 
antiseptic detergent. Do not spread contamination to uncontaminated areas.  
 
c. Rub the skin with  the applicators  to produce  good  lather.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
97  
 d. Use soft bristle  scrub  brushes  for fingernails  and other  difficult‐to‐clean  areas  as long 
as the skin barrier is maintained intact. It may be difficult to decontaminate the 
cuticles and under the nails.  
 
e. Dry the skin area  with  cleansing  tissue.  
 
f. After  the skin is thoroughly  dry, survey  it for any remaining  contamination.  
 
g. If no contamination  is detected,  apply  a good‐quality  hand  cream  to prevent 
chapping.  
 
Another  effective  non‐abrasive  decontamination  method  involves  placing  the contaminated 
hand in a cotton glove and then a Latex glove (causing the hand to perspire).  
 
The decontamination  factor is the ratio  of the initial contamination  level  to the contamination 
level after decontamination methods are applied, as determined by survey instrument 
readings. Non‐abrasive methods should be repeated until the decontamination factor 
between washes drops below 2 or 3 with significant contamination still remaining.  
 
If contamination persists on the skin, a more abrasive decontamination method may be 
necessary. The decision to proceed with a more abrasive method should be based on the 
effectiveness  of the decontamination.  An abrasive  soap  should  be applied  with  a moist  gauze 
sponge or soft brush while rubbing the skin to develop a soapy lather. Care should be exercised to prevent damage to the skin surface. If contamination persists after using the 
abrasive soap, potassium permanganate (K mnO
4) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO 3) should be 
considered. Paint the contaminated skin with K mnO 4 using cotton‐tipped applicators, allow 
the solution to dry, and paint it again two or three more times, allowing the solution to dry thoroughly between each application. The skin will then appear almost black. Applicators 
should be discarded after each use to avoid spreading contamination to the solutions. Then, 
rub the treated area with sodium bisulfate using cotton applicators, until the brown 
discoloration  is removed.  Rinse  the skin with  water  to remove  the remaining  KmnO
4 and dry 
the area thoroughly and survey it for contamination.  
 
If contamination  persists  after  all the above  decontamination  efforts,  wrap  the contaminated 
area to control the contamination and consult with medical personnel.  
 
Liberal irrigation with room temperature water or saline solution (preferable) is 
recommended  for eye,  nose,  and mouth  contamination.  These procedures  are performed  by 
the medical staff to remove contamination.  
 
4.4.2 Equipment  and Surface  Decontamination  
 
Decontamination  of surface  areas  may  be as simple  as hosing off the floors  with  water,  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
98  
 washing surfaces with detergent and water, or wiping with household dust cloths. Waste 
material generated from decontamination activities (e.g., water and wipe material) must be 
contained and disposed of as radioactive waste. For some locations, vacuuming the surfaces 
may  be appropriate.  If vacuuming is used,  HEPA‐filtered  vacuum  systems are required  to keep 
airborne radioactive material out of the vacuum exhaust.  
 
For some operations, periodic surface flushing with water may be adequate to maintain 
acceptable contamination levels. Precautions should ensure control and collection of run‐off 
water so material may be recovered and wastewater analyzed before discharge. Depending 
upon  which  isotope  of uranium  is involved,  geometrically  safe containers  may  be required  for 
collecting and holding the liquid.  
 
Depending upon the physical and chemical form of the uranium and the type of surface, 
uranium  may  become  imbedded  in the surface.  Removal  of embedded  material may  require 
physical abrasion, such as scabbling, grinding, sand blasting, or chipping, or it may be accomplished using chemical etching techniques. If the surface is porous, complete replacement could be necessary. The use of high‐pressure water ( hydro blasting ) has been 
quite successful for metal and concrete surfaces.  
 
Ultrasonic cleaning techniques, electro‐polishing, or chemical baths may be useful for decontamination  of high‐cost  items  if the chemicals  used  are compatible  with  the material to 
be cleaned.  
 
A description of different decontamination techniques is found in DOE/EM‐0383, DOE 
Decommissioning Handbook  (2000) , and publications  by the Electric  Power  Research  Institute. 
The DOE Decommissioning Handbook also includes guidance on decontamination techniques, 
assessment of environmental impacts, disposition of wastes, and preparation of 
decommissioning cost estimates.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 5 INTERNAL  DOSIMETRY  
Internal dosimetry is an essential part of a comprehensive radiological control program at 
every  facility  where  uranium  is handled  or processed.  The purpose  of an internal  dosimetry 
program is to monitor workplace activities, assess accidental or inadvertent intakes of radioactive material, and conduct internal dose assessments from bioassay measurement 
data.  
 
DOE requires that new or modified facilities be designed, operated, and remediated to prevent  intakes  of radioactive  materials  in accordance  with  10 CFR § 835.1002.  Radiological 
controls for the workplace shall ensure that under normal conditions, radionuclides are 
contained and handled properly, and that intakes are as low as reasonably achievable.  
 
Experience has shown that the most common route for inadvertent uranium intake is 
inhalation.  The uranium  may  be in natural,  enriched,  or depleted  form,  or a combination 
thereof. Intakes can also occur by accidental ingestion or by wound contamination.  
Surveillance  programs  should  be designed  to rapidly  detect  a release  in the event  of a loss of 
radioactive material containment. Internal dosimetry programs should be tailored to the 
needs of each uranium‐handling facility so that workers’ internal doses are determined by appropriate methods.  
 
When workers are inadvertently exposed to radioactive material, appropriate corrective  
action should be taken to ensure that control and containment are re‐established. Prompt 
detection by routine workplace monitoring practices is essential to regaining control after any 
contamination spread or loss of containment. Prompt workplace indicatio ns of potential  
intake are also crucial to ensure timely initiation of special bioassay monitoring for intake and 
dose assessment. An early assessment of the probable se verity of an intake and its 
corresponding dose,  preferably  within  the first two hours  of the intake,  is needed  for decisions 
on dose reduction therapy and event reporting. Uranium is both a radiological and chemical hazard. Because the total risk must be considered, both hazards must be considered. For 
uranium  intakes,  it may  take  many  months  to obtain  the bioassay  data  necessary  for final dose 
assessment. Until such data become available, ongoing preliminary assessments of intake and 
dose may be necessary to provide guidance for the administrative and medical management 
of the workers.  
 
5.1 Internal  Dose  Evaluation Program  
 
Internal  doses  are not directly  measured,  but are estimated  or calculated  based  on knowledge 
of the material to which a worker may be exposed and it’s known or assumed biokinetic 
behavior. The common approach to internal dosimetry is to calculate an occupational intake 
based on worker bioassay measurements or workplace air‐sample data an d assumed 
breathing rates. Once an intake is calculated, appropriate equivalent doses to organs and  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
100  
 tissues of concern can be estimated by using fundamental dosimetry principles, by various 
intake‐to‐dose conversion  factors,  that incorporate  assumed  biokinetic  models,  or by use of 
an appropriate computer code. Intake‐to‐dose conversion factors can be found in ICRP 
Publication 68 (1994b). Further discussion on intake and dose assessment is provided in 
Section 5.8.  
 
Participation  in internal dose  evaluation  programs  (which  include  routine  bioassay  programs) 
is required for conditions identified in 10 CFR § 835.402(c). The internal dose evaluation 
program must address both general workplace conditions and individual intakes. Workplace 
conditions are monitored through air and surface contamination mon itoring programs.  
Individual  monitoring  for intakes  is commonly  performed  using bioassay  procedures.  Bioassay 
monitoring includes both direct (in vivo) measurements of radioactivity in the body and 
indirect (in vitro) measurements of material excreted or removed from the body.  
 
10 CFR § 835.402 requires  participation  in a bioassay  program  if a general  employee  is likely  to 
exceed 0.1 rem CED from all intakes for all radionuclides in a year. Participation in a bioassay 
program is generally based on the possibility that a single intake causing a dose in excess of 
0.1 rem CED might  occur.  
 
Indications  of intake include  (but are not limited  to) detection  of facial  or nasal  contamination, 
positive air monitoring or sampling results that may indicate internal exposure, or any wound 
in which contamination is detected or suspected. The most common internal exposure 
monitoring program for workers is the bioassay program, which mu st be designed for the 
specific nuclides and forms of material at a particular facility. Likely candidates for internal exposure monitoring include personnel who may be rou tinely exposed to surface or airborne 
contamination, or those identified by workplace indicators.  
 
Workplace  monitoring  for potential  internal exposures  is performed  to verify  the adequacy  of 
containment and work practices. This monitoring includes air sampling, continuous air 
monitoring, personal contamination surveys, and workplace contamination surveys. Facilities 
are to be designed and operated to minimize internal exposure. Details regarding workplace 
monitoring and control p ractices are discussed in Chapter 4, Contamination Control.  
 
5.1.1 Performance  Capabilities  for Internal  Exposure  Monitoring  
 
Bioassay programs must be capable of showing compliance with the 5‐rem/year stochastic 
and 50‐rem/year deterministic dose limits of 10 CFR § 835.202. 10 CFR § 835.402(c)(1) 
identifies 0.1 rem CED for all likely intakes in a year as a level above which workers must participate in a bioassay program. Therefore, such bioassay monitoring programs must be 
capable  of detecting  individual  doses  at that level.  To meet  this requirement,  reliance  must  be 
placed on workplace monitoring to identify potential intakes at the time they occur so that 
special bioassay monitoring can be initiated.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
101  
 Performance capabilities for bioassay and internal dosimetry programs can be expressed as 
the minimum detectable dose, based on some combination of minimum detectable activity 
and frequency of measurement or time post‐intake at which the measurement is mad e. The 
term "minimum detectable dose" is preferred over any variants of the occasionally 
encountered terms "dose‐missed" or "potentially undetected dose," which were usually 
defined as the same thing. The connotation of the latter terms is that of an actua l intake 
which  was not detected,  whereas  the intent  was to define  a measure  of program  sensitivity  to 
doses that might have gone undetected had an intake occurred. The preferred term 
"minimum detectable dose" (MDD) ties the concept to the recognized terminology of MDA.  
 
The MDD for a bioassay program must meet the aforementioned dose limit requirements of 
10 CFR § 835.202. A design goal of 0.1 rem CED from all intakes of similar nuclides in a year is 
desirable but unrealistic for a routine program. To meet these requireme nts, bioassay 
programs should have measurement sensitivities (i.e., MDAs for bioassay measurements) 
established based on the material to which workers might be exposed. Examples of such 
sensitivities are given in Tables 5‐1 through 5‐3 for pure 238U monito red by urinalysis, fecal 
analysis, and lung counting, respectively. The bioassay goals are calculated by multiplying the 
intake (nCi) by  the intake retention  fraction (IRF) and by  a correction  factor  of 2,220 dpm/nCi, 
where intake is the dose limit divided by a calculated dose conversion factor (rem/nCi). For 
uranium‐238, for simplicity, the dose limit goal is based on the 50‐rem committed equivalent 
dose  (for type  S uranium‐238,  the stochastic  limit  is slightly  (5rem)  is slightly  more  restrictive); 
the oth er goals are based on the 0.1 rem CED monitoring threshold. Table 5‐1 through Table 
5‐3 give values for bioassay goals and the calculations used to derive them.  
 
There may  be circumstances  in which  the measurement technology  is not available  to provide 
the sensitivities required for the 0.1 rem goal using routine, periodic measurements at 
reasonable frequencies. Therefore, because the goal of 0.1 rem CED cannot be met through routine bioassay, the radiation protection organization should take the  following 
administrative actions:  
 
a. Ensure  that adequate  control  measures  are applied  to prevent  intakes.  
 
b. Document  the adequate  control  measures  for auditing purposes.  
 
c. Upgrade  bioassay  measurement  systems and workplace  monitoring  practices  to 
provide state‐of‐the‐art measurements.  
 
d. Ensure  that internal dose  assessments use state‐of‐the‐art technology.  
 
All confirmed  occupational  intakes  of uranium,  regardless  of magnitude,  should  be assessed. 
The results of all bioassay and other measurements needed to demonstrate the quality of 
measurements  and dose  assessment  should  be recorded  and maintained.  The recording and DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
102  
 reporting  requirements  for internal dosimetry  data  are set forth  in Section  3.7 of this technical 
standard .

Radiation exposure records programs must also provide for the summation of internal and 
external  doses,  as required  by 10 CFR § 835.702.  While  the summation  process  is not necessarily 
performed under a site internal dosimetry program, it is recommended that the program coordinator recognize what is required. The following summations are identified by 10 CFR § 835.702(c)(5):  
 
a. Total  effective  dose  (TED)  in a year is defined  as the summation  of effective  dose  from 
external exposure and the CED to the whole body in a year . 
 
b. For any organ or tissue assigned an internal dose during the year, the sum of the 
equivalent  dose  from  external  exposure  and the committed  equivalent  dose  to organs 
or tissues of concern . 
 
c. Cumulative TED defined as the sum of all total effective dose values recorded for an individual  plus,  for occupational  exposures  received  before  the implementation  date 
of this amendment, the cumulative total  effective  dose  equivalent  (as defined  in the 
November 4 , 1998 amendment to this rule) values recorded for an individual, where 
available, for each year occupational dose was received, beginning January 1, 1989 . 
 
d. For the embryo/fetus  of a declared  pregnant  worker,  the summation  of the equivalent  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
108  
 dose  to the mother  from  external  exposure during the entire  gestation  period  and the 
CED to the embryo/fetus from intakes by the mother during the entire gestation 
period . 
 
Doses  must  be calculated  and recorded  (if greater  than  10 mrem)  for any confirmed  uranium 
intake.  What  constitutes  a confirmed  intake  is discussed  in Section  5.7. Along  with  the doses, 
supporting records  must  be maintained,  including the  bioassay  data,  assumptions, biokinetic 
models, and calculational methods used to estimate the doses. These may be included in 
letter‐report dose assessments, databases, technical basis documents, and similar records, 
either singly or in combination.  
 
5.1.2 Protection  of the Embryo/Fetus,  Minors,  and Members  of the Public  
 
The effective dose limit for the embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant worker is 0.5 rem for the 
entire  gestation  period,  defined  as the  summation  of external dose  received  and internal  dose 
received during the gestation period (not the 50‐year committed internal dose). Internal 
exposure monitoring is required if an intake is likely to result in more than 10% of that limit 
(i.e., 50 mrem for the gestation period). Providing adequate protection to keep the mother’s 
intakes below the occupational limits will also provide adequate protection for the 
embryo/fetus. Thus, special bioassay for uranium during pregnancy is  not required. As a 
matter of caution, some sites try to obtain baseline bioassays as soon as a pregnancy is 
declared,  with  another  baseline  bioassay  following  the end of pregnancy.  Some  sites  also offer 
to restrict pregnant workers from jobs with relatively high potential for occupational intakes.  
 
Minors  and members  of the public  are limited  by 10 CFR § 835.207  and 10 CFR § 835.208  to a 
total effective dose of 0.1 rem/year. Minors are also limited to 10% of the occupational dose 
limits of 10 CFR § 835.202(a)(3) and (a)(4). Internal exposure monitoring is required if an 
intake is likely to result in 50% of that limit (0.05 rem) from all radionuclide intakes in a year.  
With  routine  fecal sampling for insoluble  uranium  (Type  S) a routine  bioassay  program  
is sufficiently  sensitive  to identify  such  intakes.  Enhanced  workplace  surveillance  or restriction 
of access may be required.  
 
5.2 Characterization of Internal  Hazards  
 
Monitoring  for uranium  poses  special  problems  for the following  reasons.  
 
a. Uranium  presents  both  chemical and radiological toxicity  risks,  the relative 
importance of which depends on its transportability from the lung.  
 
b. Uranium  usually  exists  in mixed  transportability  classes.  
 
c. Small,  recent intakes  easily  mask  larger,  older  intakes  because  nearly  50%  of the 
uranium going to blood is cleared immediately through the urine.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
109  
  
d. An intake of Type S material potentially resulting in a CED of 0.1 rem  generally cannot 
be detected  by routine  urinalysis  alone.  Monitoring  of the workplace  to document  the 
working environment and to provide immediate indication of an intake is essential 
unless a combination of urine and fecal sampling is used in the routine bioassay 
program.  
 
e. Low‐level  chronic  intakes  are common,  so the bioassay  program  must  monitor  for 
long‐term buildup as well as for potentially significant acute intakes.  
 
f. Individual  and temporal variability  in the environmental  background  of uranium 
complicates interpretation of urinalysis and fecal results.  
 
Consequently, the proper bioassay monitoring program for uranium workers is best 
determined on a case‐by‐case basis in consultation with an internal dosimetry specialist. As 
part of the program  technical  basis,  the uranium  mixtures  need  to be determined.  In addition, 
determinations should be made at the time of identified incidents of potential intake.  
Methods  for such  determination  may  include  radiochemical analysis  or chemistry  followed  by 
mass spectrometry.  
 
Solubility is of major importance in uranium inhalation toxicology. Soluble uranium 
compounds are absorbed and rapidly transported to kidney and bone, or excreted in urine. 
Because uranium damages kidney tissues by the same mechanisms as other heavy metals, 
dissolved  uranium  is considered  to be a chemical toxicant.  Dissolved  uranium  also deposits  in 
bone and is retained for long periods of time, such that sufficiently enriched uranium can 
deliver an accumulated radiation dose sufficient to be considered a radiological hazard to bone (Morrow, 1 986).  
 
Oxides of uranium tend to exhibit inhalation Type S behavior, slightly more soluble 
compounds  are assigned  to Type  M, and soluble  compounds  are assigned  to Type  F. Note  that 
some  compounds  that have  been  classified  as type  S have  shown  a more  rapid  clearance  from 
the lung than for other Type S compounds, i.e., having a 100‐day effective half‐life in the lung 
compared  to the class  S compounds  that have  a 500‐day effective  half‐life.  This may  be due to 
the existence of mixtures having more than one physicochemical form (ICRP 1988b; 
NUREG/CR‐5566, 1990). As uranium ages in a residual, loose contamination form, such as 
might be found in old duct work, glove boxes, or other such components, it can be exp ected 
to undergo slow oxidation to a more insol uble form. Thus, Type S forms of uranium may be 
reasonable assumptions of what to expect during many decommissioning operations.  
 
For depleted uranium to present a chemical toxic hazard from inhalation, the depleted 
uranium  would  have  to be subdivided  into soluble  particles  that can be inhaled,  transported 
into the lungs, and transferred to the blood for transport to the kidneys. Depleted uranium  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
110  
 metal is not readily subdivided into small, respirable particles. However, depleted uranium 
metal can slowly oxidize under ambient environmental conditions (corrosion), resulting in 
formation  of small particles.  The solubility  of uranium  oxides  may  be affected  by the rate of 
oxidation, which will vary with the temperature and water vapor present in the air.  
 
Following an accidental release from a nuclear reactor, fission and activation products may be 
present in fragments of irradiated fuel, of which the matrix is predominately uranium oxide 
(Devell,  1988;  Begichev  et al., 1989;  Toivonen  et al., 1992).  Studies  of the in vitro  dissolution  of 
particles released from the Chernobyl accident, seven out of ten of which consisted mainly of 
uranium (Cuddihy et al., 1989), were consistent in assigning all the gamma‐emitting 
radionuclides to Type M (ICRP 71).  
 
Particle  size is an important  consideration  for inhalation  exposures.  The normal practice  for an 
aerosol is to identify the activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) and its associated 
particle‐size distribution. Particle sizes of 10 µm or less are considered respirable. For 
compliance with 10 CFR Part 835, the common practice is to assume a 5‐µm particle size for 
dosimetry purposes unless actual particle size information is available. Particle size data are 
most readily obtainable for chronic exposure situations. Unless representative air sampling is 
performed in the immediate proximity of a worker during abnormal working conditions, the 
practical likelihood of obtaining good particle‐size information is slim.  
 
5.3 Scope  of Bioassay  Program  
 
For Types F and M uranium compounds, the monitoring programs need to be designed to 
maintain exposures, including those from single acute intakes, below levels that will cause 
transient  kidney  damage  due to the heavy  metal  toxicity  of uranium. Typically,  urine  sampling 
is the preferred  method  of monitoring for Types  F and M uranium.  For Type  S natural uranium 
and all types of highly enriched uranium, radiological considerations are more limiting. In addition, local factors concerning the diversity of chemic al forms of uranium must be taken 
into account when designing a bioassay monitoring program. For these materials, a combination of direct and indirect monitoring may be required.  
 
5.3.1 Classification  of Bioassay  Measurements  
 
Bioassay measurements can be classified according to the primary reason for their 
performance.  This is a useful  practice  for historically  documenting why  a worker  participated 
in a bioassay program. Numerous reasons for bioassay measurements may be defined for 
specific facilities; some suggested common classifications are as follows:  
 
a. Baseline measurements are used to establish a pre‐exposure condition, either for a new employee or as a result of a new work assignment. DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) 
recommends baseline measurements if workers are considered likely to receive 
intakes  resulting  in greater  than  100‐mrem  CED.  It is a good  practice  to perform  such  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
111  
 measurements for newly hired employees, intra‐company transferees, or workers 
transferred from facilities where bioassay measurements may not have been 
required. In addition, baseline measurements can verify workers’ status for special 
work assignments. For uranium bioassay, baseline measurements made before any 
occupational  exposure  can be expected  to yield  only  dietary  levels  of uranium  in urine 
or feces.  
 
b. A special consideration is the evaluation of intakes that include natural materials such 
as uranium. The sensitivity of urine sampling as a uranium bioassay tool is limited by 
the presence  of environmental levels  of uranium,  which  is subject  to some  uncertainty 
in interpretation.  Knowledge  of background  level  of uranium  excretion  is an important 
factor in analysis and interpretation of urine or feces for uranium bioassay purposes. In ICRP Publication 23 (1975), model values for excretion of uranium by Reference 
Man are given as 0.05 to 0.5 µg/day in urine and 1.4 to 1.8 µg/day in feces ( ICRP, 
1975). There are two distinct decisions to be made: whether a result differs from an 
analytical blank, and if so, whether the amount detected is greater than what would 
be expected in a population that is not occupationally exposed (Long et al., 1994). For example, the internal dosimetry program at Hanford distinguishes between the 
environmental decision level L
C and the analytical decision level DL (Carbaugh et al., 
1995) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) to look for the 
presence of 236U. Since the 236U isotope does not occur in nature, it is used as a flag to 
indicate occupational exposure.  
 
c. Exempting workers  from  baseline  bioassay  implies  accepting any detectable results  as 
likely attributable to current occupational exposure. However, requiring baseline 
measurements can potentially impact the schedule of short‐term jobs; the time 
required to obtain a chest count and a large‐volume urine sample may add a day or 
two delay t o entry procedures. Moreover, missing a baseline for a long‐term 
employee who will be placed on a routine bioassay program is not likely to be as troublesome as not obtaining  a baseline for a short‐term worker who provides a 
termination  sample  that shows  detection  of uranium  after  the worker  has left the site 
and is difficult to reach for follow‐up.  
 
d. Routine,  or periodic,  measurements  are performed  on a predetermined  schedule 
(e.g., an annual or quarterly frequency).  
 
e. Special  bioassay  measurements  are performed  as follow‐up  to unusual  routine 
results or suspected intakes.  
 
f. End of assignment or termination measurements are performed following 
completion  of specific  work  or at the time  of termination  of employment.  DOE‐STD‐ 
1098‐ 2017 recommends that workers who participate in bioassay programs have  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
112  
 appropriate  termination  measurements.  
 
Bioassay  classification  is important  because  the purpose  of a sample  may  affect  the collection 
and analysis or monitoring method chosen. For example, single‐void urine samples are not 
adequate for routine monitoring of potential uranium exposure, but can provide important 
information for dose‐reduction therapy following a suspected intake; samples representative 
of excretion over a 24‐hour period should be collected for quantitative intake and dose 
assessme nt. The date of sample collection (and possibly the time of collection) can be very 
important to special monitoring performed to assess intake. However, these are much less important with regard to periodic monitoring, for which measurements are not expect ed to 
show detectable activity and when any detection whatsoever is likely to initiate investigation 
and special bioassay.  
 
5.3.2 Monitoring  Requirements  and Selection  of Employees  
 
Workers who are considered likely to have intakes resulting in excess of 0.1 rem CED are 
required to participate in a bioassay program. The workers at highest risk of incurring an 
intake are the ones in closest contact with the material. Typically, these a re the operators, 
maintenance,  and radiological control  personnel  handling uranium  or uranium‐contaminated 
objects in the course of routine glovebox, maintenance, or decommissioning operations. In the event of containment system failure, it is these worker s who will most lik ely incur 
exposure and subsequent intake. These workers should be on a routine bioassay program 
designed to meet the requirements of 10 CFR Part 835 as a kind of safety net to identify 
intakes which might have gone undetected by workplace monitoring.  
 
Other  workers  (e.g.,  supervisors,  inspectors,  observers,  guards,  and tour  groups)  who  work  in 
or visit a uranium facility but are not directly working with the material or contaminated 
objects are normally at a substantially lower risk for incurring an intake. Although these 
people may not need to be on a routine bioassay program, they should be  subject to 
participation in a special bioassay program if workplace indications suggest loss of control or 
containment.  
 
Routine  bioassay  monitoring  should  be implemented  whenever  quantities  of uranium  handled 
exceed the respective quantities in Table 5‐4.  Although these values were derived using the 
older ICRP 30 models (1979), on this kilogram scale, there would not be much difference with 
the newer models.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

5.3.3 Selection of Bioassay  Monitoring  Techniques  
 
Bioassay monitoring techniques fall into two broad categories: direct measurement of 
radioactive  materials  in the body (in  vivo counting)  and analysis  of material removed  from  the 
body for laboratory (in vitro analysis). In vivo counting includes measurements of the chest, 
lung,  skeleton,  liver,  and wounds.  In vitro  measurements  include  urinalysis,  fecal analysis, and 
occasionally  analysis  of tissue,  sputum,  or blood  samples.  Methods  for in vitro  analysis  include 
liquid scintillation counting, fluorescence measurements, gamma spectrometry, chemical separation followed by electrodeposition, and counting with radiation detectors. A brief 
overview of bioassay techniques and capabilities has been developed (Selby et al., 1994).  
Further  discussion of the techniques  is provided  below.  
 
In addition,  to ensure  that adverse  chemical toxicity  effects  are unlikely,  bioassays  for uranium 
should be performed when intakes of 1 mg or more of soluble uranium are likely to occur in any one workday (ANSI, 2013a).  
 
5.3.3.1  In Vivo  Counting 
 
Direct bioassay (in vivo counting) is the measurement of radiations emitted from radioactive material taken  into and deposited  in the body.  Direct  bioassay  is appropriate  for detection  and DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
114  
 measurement of photons emitted by uranium and its decay products. Lung, wound, and 
skeleton  counting  are examples  of in vivo monitoring  most  commonly  used  for uranium  and 
its progeny.  
 
When  direct  bioassay  is used,  the detection  system  should  be calibrated  for the radionuclides 
to be measured  in the appropriate  organs.  All calibration  procedures,  calibration  records,  and 
quality control data should be maintained.  
 
A uranium  facility  should  have  the capability  to detect  and assess  depositions of  uranium  in 
the lungs of affected workers. The major objective of lung counting is to provide 
measurements of suspected intakes triggered by workplace monitoring results. Lung 
measurements  should  be made  to provide  an early  estimate of the magnitude  of the intake 
and resulting lung deposition.  
 
The most widely used systems for lung counting are high‐purity germanium detectors, thin 
sodium‐iodide  detectors,  phoswich detectors,  and proportional counters.  Multiple  high‐purity 
germanium  detectors  have  advantages  over  the other  detector  systems because  of their  good 
resolution, allowing better identification of the radionuclide, better detectability, and better background prediction capability. The main disadvantages of germanium detector arrays are 
their higher cost and lower reliability relative to other types of in vivo detectors. Germanium 
detectors also must be continuously cooled with liquid nitrogen.  
 
For natural and enriched uranium, the energy most commonly used for in vivo monitoring is 
the 185‐keV  gamma  that is emitted  with  54%  abundance  from  the decay  of 235U (ANSI,  2013a; 
Gerber and Thomas, 1992). For natural uranium, approximately 50% of the activity is due to decay  of 
234U. For enriched  uranium,  234U is the major  contributor  to total  activity.  To calculate 
dose, one needs to know the total uranium activity and the isotopic distribution of the 
material.  
 
For natural or depleted uranium, detection of the 92.4‐keV and 92.8‐keV K x‐rays emitted by 
the 234Th daughter  product  are most  commonly  used  (ANSI,  2013a; Gerber  and Thomas,  1992). 
This monitoring method would not be appropriate for freshly separated ur anium as th e 234Th 
will not be in equilibrium with the 238U and would potentially result in an underestimate or 
overestimate of the actual internal burden.  
 
Measurement equipment  to detect and measure  uranium  contamination  in wounds  should  be 
available at all uranium facilities. Instrumentation used for this purpose may include thin‐ 
crystal  NaI(Tl), intrinsic germanium, or  Si(Li) detectors.  Correction for  depth  due to absorption 
of photons in the overlying tissues should be considered. Collimated detectors are useful for 
determining the location of the uranium in wounds.  
 
Estimates  of the depth  of uranium  contamination  in a wound  may  be made  using solid‐state  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
115  
 germanium  or Si(Li) detectors to measure the relative  absorption of the low‐energy x‐rays 
emitted  by uranium.  Information  about  depth  is important  for determining whether  tissue 
excision is necessary to remove the contamination.  
 
5.3.3.2  In Vitro  Analysis  
 
The two most  common  forms  of in vitro  analysis  are urinalysis  and fecal  analysis.  
 
Urinalysis.  Urine  sampling provides  useful  information  about  the amount  of uranium excreted 
following  an intake.  After  chemical  isolation,  the uranium  in urine  samples  may  be determined 
by alpha spectrometry (gas‐flow proportional or surface‐barrier detection), alpha counting 
(zinc sulfide or liquid scintillation counting), or track counting. Analytical procedures for in 
vitro measurement of uranium and other radionuclides have been published (Volchok and 
dePlanque, 1983; Gautier, 1983 ). 
 
Urine samples should be collected away from the uranium facility to minimize cross‐ 
contamination.  Samples  should  be collected  in contamination‐free  containers;  measures 
should be considered for minimizing plateout on walls of container surfaces (such as by addition of trace amounts of gold, oxalate, or nitric acid).  
 
Fecal  Analysis.  Fecal  analysis  is a useful  procedure  for evaluating  the excretion  of uranium  and 
many other radioactive materials because more than half of the material deposited in the 
upper respiratory tract is cleared rapidly to the stomach and gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  
 
The total fecal plus urinary elimination for the first few days after exposure, combined with in 
vivo counts  that might  be obtained, may  provide the  earliest  and most  accurate  assessment  of 
intake. Fecal samples taken during the second and third day after an inhalation incident are 
likely  to provide  the most  useful  data  because  the gastrointestinal hold‐up  time  may  vary  from 
a few hours to a few days.  
 
Fecal sampling is primarily a monitoring procedure for confirming and evaluating suspected 
intakes,  but is used  at some  uranium  facilities  for routine  periodic  monitoring  as well.  Workers 
may find fecal sampling unpleasant or objectionable, and laboratory technicians may also  
have aversion to fecal sample analysis. Some of these problems may be minimized if 
commercial fecal sample collection kits are used for convenient collection and handling of 
samples. Collection kits also provide a means for collecting uncont aminated samples. Fecal 
samples may require additional sample preparation before analysis.  
 
5.4 Establishing  Bioassay  Frequency  
 
The bioassay measurement frequency should be based on: 1) the potential risks of an intake 
occurring; and 2) the sensitivity of a bioassay program to detecting potential intakes. The 
bioassay  program  sensitivity  can be selected  using specified  intervals  between  measurements  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
116  
 based  on the MDD  associated  with  an interval.  
 
The rationale  for the selected  bioassay  measurement  frequency  should  also be documented. 
It is appropriate to evaluate the probability of intake and to modify the sampling frequency 
based on that probability.  
 
The frequency of bioassay measurements should normally not be decreased because 
analytical results  are below  the detection  level.  The bioassay  program  should  be maintained 
to confirm the proper functioning of the overall internal exposure control program and to 
document the absence of significant intakes of radionuclides.  
 
5.4.1 Frequency  Based  on Program  Sensitivity  
 
The minimum detectable dose concept refers to the potential dose associated with an MDA 
bioassay  measurement at a given time  interval post‐intake.  The pattern  of retention  of activity 
in the body, the MDA for a bioassay measurement technique, and the frequency with which 
that technique is applied define a quantity of intake that could go undetected by the bioassay 
program. An intake of such a magnitude would not be detected if it occurred immediately 
after a bioassay measurement and if it were eliminated from the body at such a rate that 
nothing was detected during the next scheduled measurement. The dose resulting from such 
an intake would be the MDD for that particular measurement technique and frequency.  
 
Estimates  of MDD  in terms  of CED should  be documented  for each  measurement  technique, 
MDA, and frequency. The MDA is defined in ANSI/HPS N13.30 (2011) as a measure of the detection limit. Analytical radiobioassay laboratories should meet the Acceptable MDAs 
(AMDAs) recommended in ANSI N13.30‐2011 (2011) as a minimum. The AMDAs fo r U 
bioassay are shown in Table 5‐5.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

due to possible misinterpretation of the word "acceptable". The AMDAs have been replaced 
with test ranges for externally conducted quality control tests that take into consideration 
the need to be several times MDA or  more before reasonably low  coefficients of variation  
can be obtained for individual  sample measurements.  In this way,  bias as well as precision  
can be estimated from reasonably small samples within each test category.  
 
 
Retention  functions  specific  to the various  chemical  forms  and particle  size distributions  found 
in the facility should be used. Examples of MDD tabulations can be found in La Bone et al. 
(1993)  and Carbaugh et  al. (1994). In establishing MDD tables, it is important to consider dose 
contributions from all appropriate radionuclides in any mixture, rather than just the dose 
contribution from the bioassay indicator nuclide.  
 
The minimum  frequency  for routine  bioassay  programs  is interrelated  to action  levels,  as 
specified in Table 5‐6 (ANSI, 2013a). Special bioassays are taken as needed.  Mass determination  Uranium  (natural)  5 µg/L  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

5.4.2 Frequency  Based on Potential  Risk  of Intake 
 
Although  uranium  workers  are not generally  considered to be at high  risk of incurring intakes 
that might result in CEDs of 0.1 rem  or more, any uranium worker can be considered to have 
the potential for such an intake (see Section 5.3.2). However, having the potential for intake 
does not mean that they are likely to incur an intake.  
 
Workers who have the highest potential risk  for an intake are those  most closely working with 
uranium or uranium‐contaminated material. Typically, these workers are glove‐box workers, maintenance workers, and operational radiological control surveillance staff. These workers 
should be on a routine uranium bioassay program,  including urinalysis and in vivo 
measurements. Such programs are relatively insensitive compared to the 0.1 rem CED 
monitoring threshold and are a safety net intended to catch intakes of significance relative to 
regulatory limits, rather than substantially lower administrative levels. Selection of bioassay 
frequency depends on the facility experience with potential intakes, the perceived likelihood of intake, and the MDD of a program. Annual urinalyses and in vivo chest counts are fairly typical. More  frequent  (e.g.,  semi‐annual  or quarterly)  measurements  may  permit  more  timely 
review of workplace indicators in the event that an abnormal bioassay result is obtained, but do not necessarily m ean a more sensitive program.  
 
5.4.3 Special  Bioassay  as Supplements  to Routine Bioassay  Programs  
 
Special bioassay programs for workers with known or suspected acute inhalation intakes of uranium or other alpha‐emitting radionuclides should include both urine and fecal sampling. Special bioassay  measurements  should  be initiated  for each  employee  in a contaminated  work 
area when surface contamination is detected by routine surveillance if it is possible that the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
119  
 contamination resulted in a CED of 0.1 rem or greater. Excreta samples should not be  
collected  where  they  may  be contaminated  by external  sources  of uranium.  Ideally,  total  urine 
and feces should be collected for about a week following intake. This permits a sensitive 
assessment of potential intake and internal dose. Longer‐term special samples collected at 
various times from a month to a year following intake can help to dis criminate between 
ingestion, Type M inhalation, and Type S inhalation.  
 
5.4.4 Long‐term  Follow‐up  Bioassay  Programs  
 
Following  an intake,  a long‐term  follow‐up  bioassay  program  may  be required  for a worker  to 
compare the actual excreta or in vivo results with those projected by the evaluation. This is 
important  to verify  the accuracy  of intake and dose  assessments.  The frequency  and duration 
of a special program is dependent upon the projected values;  it is suggested that as long as a 
worker continues to have detectable bioassay results, he or she should continue to be monitored. It is particularly important to have good baseline data and projections for 
individuals who return to uranium work.  
 
The ability  of a bioassay  program  to distinguish  between  an established,  elevated  baseline  and 
a new potential intake  is important in the  continued monitoring of workers  once  an intake has 
occurred.  Because  of statistical fluctuations  in low‐level  uranium  measurements,  it can be very 
difficult to identify a new intake by routine bioassay if a worker has an elevated baseline.  
 
5.4.5 Other  Frequency  Situations  
 
For chronic  exposures  to soluble  uranyl  compounds  approaching the occupational  exposure 
limits,  more  frequent  bioassays  should  be taken.  Some  suggested frequencies  are to sample 
after each work break and to sample at the beginning or end of the work week.  
 
If exposure to pure  class  Y material occurs,  monitoring  may  be done  either  by fecal  analysis,  or 
urinalysis methods with lower MDAs. As a minimum, the monitoring must be adequate to 
show compliance with the dose limits (10 CFR § 835.402(d)). Increased frequency is one way 
to lower MDAs for urinalysis for the average of a number of measurements.  
 
5.5 Administration of a Bioassay  Program  
 
Administering  a bioassay  program  requires  that the policies,  procedures,  materials,  support 
facilities, and staff be in place to enable a bioassay program to commence. Among the 
administrative items to address are the following:  
 
a. Management  policy  requiring participation  in bioassay  program  by appropriate 
workers (may be part of an overall radiation protection policy) ; 
 
b. Implementing procedures  (e.g.,  criteria for who  should  participate,  scheduling,  sample ; DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
120  
 kit instructions,  sample  kit issue/receipt,  follow‐up  to unsuccessful  sample  or 
measurement attempts, data‐handling) ; 
 
c. Arrangements with appropriate analytical laboratories, including specifications of 
analysis  sensitivity,  processing times,  reporting requirements,  and quality  assurance 
provisions ; 
 
d. Onsite  support  facilities  (e.g.,  sample  kit storage  locations,  sample  kit issue/collection 
stations, measurement laboratory facilities, equipment maintenance) ; 
 
e. Staff selection,  qualification,  and training ; 
 
f. Total  CED from  all intakes  during a year ; 
 
g. Committed  equivalent  dose  to organs  or tissues  of concern  from  all intakes  during a 
year ; 
 
h. Magnitude  of intake  for each  radionuclide  during a year; 
 
i. Data necessary  to allow  subsequent  verification,  correction,  or recalculation  of doses ; 
 
j. Gestation  period  equivalent  dose  to the embryo/fetus  from  intake  by the mother 
during the entire gestation period . 
 
Recommendations  for testing  criteria for radiobioassay  laboratories  are in ANSI  N13.30.  These 
recommendations include calculational methods and performance criteria for bias, precision, 
and testing levels. The establishment of minimum detection capability must be driven by programmatic needs, ideally related to some concept of a minimum detectable dose, rather 
than as a single magnitude number.  
 
Some  sites have established  brief flyers  or brochures  describing their  bioassay  measurements. 
These  may  be distributed  to workers  during  classroom training,  upon  notification  of scheduled 
measurements, or at the time of the measurement or sample.  
 
The choice  of the measurement  technique,  or of a combination  of techniques,  depends  on the 
radioisotopes, physicochemical forms, and exposure pathway.  
 
Because  of the wide  range  of chemical and physical  forms  of uranium,  an appropriate  bioassay 
program is one that does not rely on assumed transportability and will provide data from 
which radiation dose can be calculated that will not be dependent on the chemical form. This 
will normally require both in vivo and in vitro bioassay. If the uranium being handled has been 
shown to be of medium to high transportability, then the bioassay program must be designed  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
121  
 to demonstrate  that 3 µg U/g kidney  has not been  exceeded.  
 
Uranium  Type  S materials  cannot  be effectively  detected  at the levels  listed  in ICRP  Publication 
54 by ordinary methods available for either lung in vivo counts or urinalysis (ICRP, 1989). This 
is shown by the fact that the DIL (based on 0.3 ALI as per ANSI/HPS N13.22‐2013 (2013a)) was  
0.06 pCi L‐1, which is below the MDA suggested as reasonable for routine uranium alpha 
urinalysis  (0.1 pCi L‐1) in the standard.  A combination  of urine  and fecal  sampling for Type  S 
materials will allow for adequate detection of uranium.  
 
5.5.1 In Vivo  Monitoring  
 
The scheduling and measurement process for obtaining in vivo measurements is usually 
straightforward. Workers are scheduled for the measurements and results are available 
shortly after the measurement is completed. The long counting times can impose limita tions 
on the throughput of workers through a measurement facility, making scheduling an 
important issue. Procedures should be in place to ensure that workers arrive for scheduled 
measurements  and that follow‐up  occurs  when  a measurement is not completed  or a worker 
fails to show.  
 
Occasionally,  workers  are found  who  are claustrophobic  when  placed  inside  in vivo counter 
cells.  Leaving  the cell door  partially  open  may  help  reduce  some  of the anxiety,  but will also 
likely compromise the low background for which the system is designed.  
 
Many  workers  want  to know  the results  of their  measurements.  While  a simple  statement  by 
the in vivo measurement  technician may  be adequate,  a form  letter  stating  that results were 
normal (or showed no detection of any of the nuclides of concern) can provide permanent verification.  If results  are not  normal, a  form  letter can  also be used  to explain  what  happens 
next.  
 
In vivo analysis is most useful for characterizing inhalation exposure of Type M or S compounds of uranium by lung counting. MDAs are generally not sufficiently low to provide reliable  information  about  systemic  distribution  of soluble  uranium  at occupational  levels.  The 
235U decays  with  emission  of an energetic  (186‐keV)  photon  in high  abundance that  is used  for 
in vivo monitoring of enriched uranium workers. The other long‐lived uranium isotopes emit 
only low yields of low‐energy photons (<60 keV), which are easily attenuated by body tissue  
and have limited usefulness for in vivo analysis. Internal exposures to aged depleted uranium can be measured in vivo by taking advantage of several photons of moderate energy (63‐93 
keV) emitted by the 
234mPa daughter of 234Th, which are both short‐lived daughters of 238U. 
 
An important aspect of any in vivo measurement program is the calibration and verification testing  of the measurement equipment.  In vivo measurement results  are highly  dependent  on 
the determination of a background result. Likewise, calibration using known activities in  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
122  
 appropriate  phantoms  is also important.  
 
5.5.2 Urine  Sampling  
 
Urine sampling programs can be effectively administered using either workplace or home 
collection protocols. Workplace sampling protocols must determine whether adequate 
precautions are taken to prevent external contamination of the sample by levels of act ivity 
well below the detection capabilities of friskers and workplace monitors. Home collection 
protocols have the advantage of being sufficiently removed from the workplace to render 
essentially nonexistent the potential of very low‐level contamination of  the sample from 
external  sources  of uranium.  Avoidance  of very  minor  external  contamination  of the samples 
is extremely important due to the dosimetric implications of uranium in urine.  
 
Large‐volume urine samples are necessary for bioassay monitoring due to the very small urinary excretion rates. Ideally, 24‐hour total samples would be preferred; however, such 
samples  often  impose  substantial  inconvenience  on workers,  resulting in noncompliance  with 
the instructions. As an alternative, total samples can be simulated by either time‐collection 
protocols or volume normalization techniques.  
 
One method of time‐collection simulation (NCRP 87, 1987a; Sula et al., 1991) is to collect all 
urine voided from 1 hour before going to bed at night until 1 hour after rising in the morning 
for two consecutive  nights.  This technique  has been  reviewed  with  regard  to uranium  (Medley 
et al. 1994) and found to underestimate daily urine excretion by about 14%. Such a finding is not unexpected, since the time span defined by the protocol is likely to be about 18 to 22 
hours for most people.  
 
The volume  normalization  technique  typically  normalizes  whatever  volume  is collected  to the 
ICRP Reference Man daily urine excretion volume of 1400 ml. Reference Woman excretion 
(1000 mL/d) may be used for gender‐specific programs. As a matter of practicality, routine 
monitoring programs do not usually use gender as a basis of routine data in terpretation, 
particularly since results are anticipated to be nondetectable under normal conditions.  
 
A third method calls for collection of a standard volume (e.g., 1 liter) irrespective of the time 
over  which  the sample  is obtained.  This method  uses  the standard  volume  as a screening tool 
only for routine monitoring. It does not attempt to relate measured routine excretion to 
intake, relying on well‐defined and timely supplemental special bioassay to give true or 
simulated daily excretion rates.  
 
The most common sample collection containers are 1‐liter polyethylene bottles. Although 
glass bottles are also used, they pose additional risks of breakage. Wide‐mouthed bottles are 
preferred  for convenience  and sanitation.  The number  of bottles  included  in the kit should  be 
appropriate  to the protocol;  for a total  24‐hour  protocol,  as much  as 3 liters  can be expected.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
123  
 Special provisions,  such  as a funnel  or transfer cup,  may  improve  the esthetics  of sample 
collection and provide for added worker cooperation.  
 
Some concerns can exist with length of sample storage before analysis. Storage may come 
from delays before batching samples in‐house or due to transportation times to an offsite 
laboratory. The longer a sample stands, the more chemical and biological chang e it can 
undergo,  typically  manifesting  itself as sedimentation  and plate‐out  on container walls.  While 
samples  can be preserved  by acidification  or freezing,  good  radiochemistry  techniques  should 
ensure essentially complete recovery of any plate‐out or sediment. Samples sent offsite for 
analysis can be preserved with acid, but this method imposes hazardous material shipping 
requirements. Freezing samples can preserve them, but plate‐out and sedimentation upon 
thawing should still be expected.  
 
Precautions are necessary if a lab uses an aliquot for analysis and extrapolates the aliquot 
result  to the total  sample.  The aliquoting  procedure  should  be tested  using spiked  samples  to 
determine if it is representative.  
 
A quality  control  (QC)  verification  program  should  exist  for laboratory  analyses,  including use 
of known blank samples and samples spiked with known quantities of radioactivity. Ideally, 
the samples should not be distinguishable by the analytical laboratory from actual worker 
samples. The number of QC verification samples may range from 5% to 15%  of the total 
samples processed by a large‐volume program; a small program focused on submittal of 
special samples  following  suspected  intakes  may  have  a much  highe r percentage of controls. 
An additional QC provision may be to request the analytical lab to provide results of their in‐ 
house QC results for independent review.  
 
There are no standard or regulatory requirements for bioassay sample chain‐of‐custody 
provisions,  nor has there  been  consensus  on their  need.  Tampering  with  samples  has not been 
a widely reported or suspected problem. Site‐specific chain‐of‐custody requirements should be based on balancing the need with the resources required to implement them. Some sites 
have no chain‐of‐custody requirements associated with bioassay sample collection. At other 
sites, a simple seal placed on a sample container following collection by the subject worker is 
an effective means of providin g a small degree of chain‐of custody. At the more complex level 
would be strict accountability requiring signature of issue, certification of collection, and 
signature of submittal.  
 
Procedures describing details of the bioassay program should be documented. These 
procedures  should  include  a description  of sample  collection,  analysis,  calibration  techniques, 
QC, biokinetic modeling, and dose calculational methods used.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
124  
 5.5.3 Fecal  Sampling  
 
Fecal analysis is most useful in the first few days after a known acute exposure, since a large 
fraction  of either  an ingestion  or inhalation  deposition  is excreted  in feces.  Chronic  inhalation 
exposures to Type M or S uranium can also be characterized by fecal analysis, since a large 
fraction of the material clears to the GI tract and is eliminated in feces. Urinalysis is the only 
reliable method for determining inhalation exposures t o Type F uranium and for monitoring 
the excretion  of systemic  uranium.  It also provides  complementary  information,  which,  when 
used with in vivo or fecal monitoring results, contributes to greater accuracy in internal dose assessments. Because urinalysis is generally less disruptive to work schedules than in vivo 
monitoring and more acceptable to workers than fecal monitoring , it occupies a prominent 
place in most uranium bioassay programs.  
 
Fecal analysis is often more likely to detect exposure to highly insoluble Type S material than 
urinalysis.  The ratio  between  the fecal  excretion  level  per day and the urine  excretion  level  per 
day is greater than 7, as calculated for a 90‐day sampling interval. All action levels are above the typically attainable MDA for fecal analysis of 0.1 pCi per L (ANSI, 2011b). Thus, it is 
recommended that facilities that have a significant Type S uran ium exposure potential should 
have fecal analysis capabilities available to them, unless they have urinalysis methods that 
have MDAs well below the 0.1 pCi per sample (ANSI, 2013a).  
 
A fecal sampling program must be  designed to optimize worker cooperation, whether 
collecting samples at home or in the workplace. Since the frequency of fecal voiding varies 
greatly  from  person  to person,  the sample  collection  program  must  be adaptable.  Flexibility  in 
sample dates is important. It is suggested that when a fecal sample  is required, the worker be 
provided with a kit and instructed to collect the sample, noting the date and time of voiding 
on the sample label. This practice can reduce the like lihood of unsuccessful samples. If 
multiple  samples  are required  (for example,  to collect  the total early  fecal clearance  following 
an acute inhalation exposure), the worker may be given several kits and told to collect the next several voids, noting the date and time of each.  
 
Since the total fecal voiding should be collected, thought must be given to the kit provided. 
Fecal sampling kits can be obtained from medical supply companies or designed by the site. A 
typical kit might include a large plastic zipper‐closure bag to hold the sample, placed inside a  
1‐ to 2‐liter collection bucket with a tight‐fitting lid. The bucket and bag can be held in place 
under a toilet seat by a trapezoid‐shaped bracket with a hole through it sized to hold the 
bucket.  After  sample  collection,  the zipper  bag is sealed,  the lid is snapped  tight  on the bucket, 
and the bucket placed in a cardboard box.  
 
Following  collection,  the provisions  for sample  handling,  control,  analytical,  and QC are similar 
to those described above for urine samples. One particular concern for fecal analysis is the 
potential difficulty of dissolving class S uranium in the fecal matrix. While nitric acid  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
125  
 dissolution  may  be adequate,  enhanced  digestion  using hydrofluoric  acid may  be preferred.  
 
5.5.4 Conditions  for Adjustments  of Action  Levels  
 
When workers are potentially exposed to other radiation sources or toxic agents, the action 
levels should be reevaluated. Since uranium has both chemical and radiological toxicity 
characteristics,  urinalysis  results  should  be interpreted  both  in terms  of mass  and radioactivity 
to ensure that the most appropriate set of action levels is used (ANSI, 2013a).  
 
5.6 Interpretation of Bioassay  Results  
 
Bioassay  measurements  detecting  uranium  in workers  can be initially  interpreted  as indicating 
that occupational intakes may have occurred. Standard bioassay procedures are not 
sufficiently sensitive to detect or differentiate occupational intakes from the range of 
environmental background  levels in  vivo or in excreta.  For example,  there may be  significantly 
elevated  uranium  bioassay  results  in certain  populations  who  obtain  their  drinking water  from 
wells. Since most uranium bioassay measurement procedures include counting for radioactivity as the final step in the measurement process, th ey are also subject to the 
statistics associated with the counting process.  
 
Two  key questions  associated  with  bioassay  data  are: 
 
1) When  does  a sample  result  indicate  the presence  of something (i.e.,  when  is the analyte 
detected?  
 
2) What  is the overall  capability  of the bioassay  method  for continual  assurance  of 
detection of the analyte?  
 
The decision level L c (also called the critical level for detection) is the level for a given 
measurement that indicates the likely presence of the analyte. The L c is dependent on the 
probability of obtaining false positive results (type I, or alpha, error) that is acceptable to the 
program. A 5% probability of false‐positive results is a common design parameter of 
measurement programs, implying that for a large num ber of measurements, 5% of the time 
results will be indicated as positive when in fact there is no activity presen t. The L c is 
calculated from results of analyses of blank samples. Once a measurement is performed, it is 
appropriate  to compare  it with  the Lc to determine  whether  or not the result  is "positive"  (i.e., 
the analyte is detected).  
 
The MDA  is the level  at which  continued  assurance  of detection  can be provided.  The MDA  is a 
function of the probabilities of both false positive and false negative (type II, or beta) errors 
and is typically based on a 5% probability for each kind of error. The MDA is also determined 
from analysis of blank samples, but is substantially higher th an the L c. The MDA is appropriate 
for use in designing bioassay programs and as the basis for estimating minimum detectable  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
126  
 intakes and doses as indicators of program sensitivity. The MDA should not be used as a 
comparison  with  actual measurements  to determine  whether  or not activity  is present (i.e.,  
<MDA  is not an appropriate  use of the concept).  
 
Methods  for calculating  both  Lc and MDA  are given  in ANSI  N13.30 (2011).  
 
As an alternative  to the Lc and MDA  of classical statistics, there have  been  proposals  (Miller et 
al., 1993) to use Bayesian statistical methods for evaluating bioassay data.  
 
General follow‐up  actions  to abnormal bioassay  measurements  should  include  data  checks, 
timely  verification  measurements,  work  history  reviews,  and performance  of special in vivo 
measurements or excreta sample analyses for intake and dose assessments.  
 
5.6.1 In Vivo  Count  Results  
 
In vivo uranium measurements are generally relatively insensitive with regard to levels of occupational exposure concern. This applies particularly to routine chest or lung counting, 
skeleton counting, and liver counting. For that reason, any detection of uranium should be 
investigated. T he investigation should address the validity of the measurement by reviewing 
the spectrum and its associated background subtraction. These reviews are particularly 
important  if the result  is near  the L
c. Follow‐up  to a positive  result  should  include  a conf irming 
measurement. Ideally, this should be an immediate (same day) recount of equal or higher sensitivity. The farther removed in time a verification measurement is from the original measurement, the more important it becomes to factor in potential lung c learance in 
comparing the two measurements. A follow‐up measurement taken 30 days after an initial high‐routine may not be capable of providing verification if the material of concern exhibits 
type M behavior.  
 
Chest‐wall thickness has a significant impact on chest counting. Corrections are commonly 
made  using a height‐to‐weight  ratio  or ultrasonic  methods  (Kruchten  and Anderson,  1990).  
 
Corrections may be required to address apparent detection in one tissue resulting from 
photon crossfire from another tissue. For example, chest counting is performed primarily to 
estimate activity in the lung. Yet, there is substantial bone over the lungs (rib cage, sternum) 
and behind the lungs (vertebrae). Plutonium and uranium are both bone‐seeking 
radionuclides  which  will deposit  on those  bone  surfaces  and can interfere  with  chest  counting. 
It is possible for a person having a systemic burden of uranium from a wound in the finger to manifest a positive chest count from material translocated to the skeleton, axillary lymph 
nodes, or liver (Carbaugh et al. ,1989; Graham and Kirkham, 1 983; Jefferies and Gunston, 
1986). Interpreting such a chest count as a lung burden can render dose estimates somewhat inaccurate.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
127  
 When comparing in vivo measurements made over many years, it is important to make sure 
that the measurements are, in fact, comparable. One consideration is to make sure that 
corrections have been consistently applied to all similar measurements. It is not unusual for 
measurement systems  to be replaced  or to change  the algorithms  used  for calculating  results 
over time. Step changes in data can occur and should be addressed in monitoring long‐term 
detectable trends (Carbaugh et al., 1988).  
 
In vivo wound counting for uranium is usually one facet of special bioassay. While a portable 
alpha survey meter may show if surface contamination is present at the wound site or 
contamination of the wounding object, alpha detectors are not capable of meas uring 
imbedded activity or activity masked by blood or serum. Thus, uranium facilities should have 
available a wound counter utilizing a thin sodium iodide or semi‐conductor (e.g., planar 
germanium) detector. Such detectors are capable of measuring the low ‐energy photons 
emitted from uranium. The ability to accurately quantify wound activity is highly variable, 
depending on the calibration of the equipment and how deeply imbedded material is in the 
wound.  If the object  causing  a wound  and blood  smears  taken  at the time  of a wound  show  no 
detectable activity, then a wound count also showing no detectable activity is probably 
sufficient to rule out an intake. If the wounding object or the blood smears show detectable activity,  special  urine  samples  should  be obtained  regardless  of the wound  count  result.  In this 
latter circumstance, lack of detectable activity on a wound count could be attributable to 
deeply imbedded material at the wound site or to rapid transportation of material from the 
wound to the systemic compartment.  
 
5.6.2 Urine  Sample  Results  
 
Detection of uranium activity in a routine or special urine sample using commonly available 
radiochemical measurement techniques should be investigated as a potential intake. A data 
review  should  be made  to determine if the sample  result  was correctly  determined,  and batch 
QC sample data should be verified.  
 
If the result  is near the L c, it is possible that  statistical fluctuation of  the measurement process 
could account for the apparent detection. Recounting the final sample preparation once or 
twice can be a helpful technique to verify a result or classify it as a false‐positive. If the first 
recount  also detects  the analyte,  it can be concluded  that the sample  does  contain  the analyte 
(the likelihood of two consecutive false positives at a 5% type I error per measurement is 
0.0025, or 0.25%.) If the first recount does not detect the analyte, a second recount can be 
performed as a tie‐breaker.  
 
An investigation  should  be initiated  for any abnormal  uranium  urinalysis  result.  "Abnormal" 
for a person  with  no prior history  of intake  should  be interpreted  as any detectable  activity.  
 
Once  an intake  is confirmed,  obtaining sufficient  samples  is necessary  to establish  a DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
128  
 reasonably anticipated baseline against which future measurements can be compared. This is 
important  both  to provide  future  verification  of the accuracy  of the assessment  and to identify 
potential additional intakes.  
 
The statistical fluctuation  of low‐level  measurements  can be particularly  troublesome  for long‐ 
term excretion patterns. Factors of two can be easily expected due to day‐to‐day variability 
and imprecise adherence by the worker to urine collection protocols.  
 
5.6.3 Fecal  Sample  Results  
 
Fecal samples are much more sensitive to detection of intakes than are urine samples and, 
consequently, are an important part of follow‐up bioassay monitoring for potential intakes 
initially identified by workplace indications. Pitfalls to the data interpretation include highly variable individual fecal voiding patterns, ranging from more than one per day to one every 
few days. This makes it extremely important to know what time interval is represented by a 
collected  fecal sample.  While  a single  set of fecal  data  can be normalized  to a daily  excretion 
rate for Reference Man, it is not likely to improve the quality of assessment.  
 
The preferred fecal sampling protocol following an intake is to collect all the early fecal clearance (meaning total feces for the first 5 to 7 days). This method will allow a good 
estimation of inhalation or ingestion intake, but does not readily permit discrimination of 
inhalation  from  ingestion, or  identify  whether  inhaled  material exhibits  Type  F, M, S clearance 
patterns. For optimum interpretation, total fecal collection should be interpreted in light of 
early  urine  and in vivo data  for preliminary  estimates.  The urine  data  is likely  to be particularly 
valuable in conjunction with fecal data to classify an intake as Type M or S. Longer‐term follow‐up fecal samples at nominally 30, 60, and 90 days post‐intake should substantially improve the classification of material as Type M or S.  
 
5.6.4 Use of Air Sample  Data  in Internal  Dosimetry  
 
Results of air sampling and continuous air monitoring implying more than 40 DAC‐hours exposure should be used to initiate special bioassay to assess intakes of uranium. Although 
bioassay data are the preferred method for assessing intakes and internal dose s, air sample 
data can be used if bioassay data are unavailable or determined to be inadequate or 
nonrepresentative.  Air sample  data  can be used  to calculate  an exposure  to airborne  material 
either in terms of DAC‐hours or potential radioactivity intake as  follows:  
 
DAC  - hours = Air Concentration  x Duration (hours)  
DAC  
Intake  = Air Concentration x Breathing  Rate x  Time  
 
If air sample  results  are HE,50  representative of air breathed  by individuals,  then  doses  can be DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
129  
 50 calculated using the 5‐rem stochastic limit for CED (E 50) or the 50‐rem nonstochastic limit for 
committed  tissue dose  equivalent  (HT,50) and the respective  stochastic  or nonstochastic  DAC  or 
ALI conversion factor, as shown bel –ow: 
 
–
 
E50  
= (DAC  - hours) x  Dose Limit 
2000 DAC  - hours  
 
E = Intake  x Dose  Limit  
ALI 
If respiratory  protection  is worn  by workers,  the appropriate  respirator protection  factor  may 
be applied to the above calculations (i.e., dividing the calculated result by the protection 
factor.)  
 
General air sampling programs should be augmented by breathing zone sampling when air 
concentrations to which individuals are exposed might be highly variable. Breathing zone 
sampling may include both fixed‐location and personal (lapel) air samplers. Personal air samples are more likely to be representative of actual exposure conditions than are samples 
collected  at fixed  locations,  and they  can be particularly  useful  for assessing potential  intakes 
involving short‐term exposure to well‐monitored air concen trations.  
 
5.7 Dose  Assessment  
 
Understanding the behavior  of uranium  in the body is essential  for being  able  to model  the 
uranium  body  burden  on the basis  of a bioassay.  Knowledge  of pathways  the radionuclides 
follow, the organs and systems that make up the pathways, the rates at which the radionuclides  travel  along  these  pathways,  and the rates  at which  they  are eliminated  from 
the body are essential for determining radiation dose.  The US Department of Health and 
Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Toxicological Profile for Uranium (2013) details the toxicokinetics of uranium in the body.  
 
Dose assessment involves collecting and analyzing information concerning a potential intake and developing a conclusion regarding the magnitude of intake and its associated committed 
dose equivalents. Dose assessments are conducted by investigating the nature of a potential intake and by analyzing bioassay measurement results or other pertinent data. Biokinetic 
models are used in conjunction with bioassay data to evaluate the intake, uptake, and 
retention  of uranium in the  organs and tissues of  the body. In take estimates can  then be used 
to calculate committed effective and organ dose equivalents. It is essential that good 
professional judgement  be used  in evaluating  potential  intakes  and assessing internal doses. A 
number of considerations for dose assessments have been identified (Carbaugh 1994).  
 
Computer  codes are commonly  used  for assessment of intakes,  dose  calculation,  and bioassay 
or body content projections. An overview of what should be considered in selecting a  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
130  
 computer code, as well as descriptions of a number of internal dosimetry codes available in 
1994,  has been  developed  (La Bone  1994).  Internal  dosimetry  code  users  should  understand 
how the code works and be aware of its limitations. Computer codes merely provide the 
logical result of the input they are given. Use of a particular computer code does not 
necessarily mean a dose estimate is correct.  
 
As used in this section, the definition of "intake" is the total quantity of radioactive material taken into the body. Not all material taken into the body is retained. For example, in an 
inhalation intake, the ICRP Publication 68 (1994b) respiratory tract  model predicts that, for 5‐ 
µm particles, 82% of the intake will be deposited in the respiratory tract; the other 18% is immediately exhaled. For a wound intake, material may be initially deposited at the wound 
site. Once the material has been deposited, it can be taken up into systemic circulation either 
as an instantaneous process (e.g., direct intravenous injection of a dissolved compound) or 
gradually (e.g., slow absorption from a wound site or the pulmonary region of the lung). Both the instantaneous and slow absorption processes are often referred to as uptake to the 
systemic  transfer compartment  (i.e.,  blood).  Once  material has been  absorbed  by the blood,  it 
can be translocated to the various systemic organs and tissues.  
 
An understanding of this terminology is important to review of historical cases. Before DOE 
Order  5480.11,  many  sites  reported  internal doses  not as dose  equivalent  estimates  but as an 
uptake (or projected uptake) expressed as a percentage of a maximum permissible body 
burden (MPBB). The standard tabulated values for MPBBs were those in ICRP Publication 2 
(1959). Many archived historical records may have used this approach. DOE Order 5480.11 
(now superseded) required calculation of dose equivalent. Now, 10 CFR Part 835 has codified the calculation of intakes and committed doses.  
 
5.7.1 Methods  of Estimating  Intake  
 
There are several published methods for estimating intake from bioassay data (Skrable et al., 
1994; Strenge et al., 1992; ICRP, 1989; King, 1987). These methods each employ an idealized 
mathematical model of the human body showing how materials are retained in and excreted 
from  the body  over  time  following  the intake.  An intake  retention  function  (IRF)  is a simplified 
mathematical description of the complex biokinetics of a radioactive material in the human 
body. These functions are used to predict the fraction of an intake that will be present in any 
compartment of th e body, including excreta, at any time post‐intake. Intake retention 
functions incorporate an uptake retention model that relates uptake to bioassay data and a 
feed model that relates intake to uptake and bioassay data. ICRP Publication 54 (1989) and 
other s (Lessard et al., 1987) contain compilations of IRFs.  
 
In its simplest form, a compartment content at any time post‐intake (Q t) can be expressed as 
the product  of intake  multiplied  by the intake  retention  function  value  for compartment  Q at 
time t post‐intake, or:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
131  
  
Qt = Intake  x IRF(Q t) 
 
Results  predicted  by the model  can then  be compared  with  the observed  bioassay  data.  Such 
results are often referred to as expectation values.  
 
Simple  algebraic  manipulation  of the model  allows  calculation  of intake  from  the 
compartment content at time t, as shown below:  
 
 
Intake  =  Qt  
IRF(Q t) 
When  multiple  data  points  are available  for a compartment,  the intake  can be estimated  using 
an unweighted or weighted least‐squares fitting procedure, as described by Skrable (1994)  
and Strenge (1992) or as can be found in most statistics textbooks. As an alternative, data can 
be fit by eye to a graphical plot;  however,  the apparent  fit can be misleading  if data  have  been 
logarithmically transformed.  
 
Intake can also be estimated  from  air sample  data,  as described  in Section  5.7.4.  This method 
is appropriate if bioassay data are not available or insufficiently sensitive. Intake estimates 
based on air samples and bioassay data are also appropriate as a check on each other. Valid 
bioassay data showing detectable results should be given pref erence over intake estimates 
based on air sample results.  
 
5.7.2 Alternate  Methods  of Intake  Assessment  
 
Historically, intake as described in the foregoing section was not always calculated when 
assessing uranium  exposures.  Estimates  of uptake  using recognized  methods  (Langham  1956, 
Healy 1957, Lawrence 1987) focused on assessing the magnitude of radioactivity retained in 
the body, rather than intake (which includes material not retained and of no dosimetric 
significance). These methods were (and are) dosimetrically sound in so far as estimates of deposition and uptake are concerned.  
 
5.7.3 Estimating  Effective  Dose  from  Intakes  of Uranium  
 
The committed  equivalent  dose  resulting  from  an intake of uranium  may  be calculated  by 
multiplying the estimated intake (I) by an appropriate dose conversion factor (DCF):  
 
H50 = I x DCF  
 
Dose  conversion  factors  can be obtained  from  tabulated  data  in ICRP  Publication  68 (1994b) 
or calculated directly using computer programs.  
 
Values  for simplified  dose  conversion  factors  can be obtained by dividing a dose  limit  by the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
132  
 corresponding value for the ALI. A caution must be observed with this approach: not all 
tabulated values of ALIs are the same. The ALIs are commonly rounded in most tabulations to 
one significant figure. Substantial variation can occur as a result of unit conversion. Such 
rounding errors  can introduce  significant  discrepancies  in dosimetry  calculations.  This method 
also raises  a question  about  which  ALI should  be used  if compliance  monitoring  is being based 
on comparison with secondary limits, such as the ALI rather than the primary d ose limits.  
 
Where individual‐specific data are available, the models should be adjusted. However, the general lack of capability  to monitor  organ‐specific  retention  for uranium  (i.e.,  content  and 
clearance half‐times) makes the use of default models most practical.  
 
Ideally, one should obtain as much bioassay information as possible to determine the intake 
and track  the retention  of uranium  in the body  to reduce  the uncertainty  associated  with  the 
daily variation in the measurements. A regression analysis should be used to fit the measurement values for estimating the initial intake and clearance half‐times.  
 
5.8 Reference and Action  Levels  
 
Reference and action levels are essential to operation of a routine internal dosimetry program.  Because  a wide  range  of levels  can be defined  by various  facilities  and organizations, 
this document does not attempt to prescribe particular level titles. As used in this document, reference and action levels are simply workplace or bioassay measurements, or associated 
calculated doses, at which specific actions occur.  
 
Notification levels based on workplace indicators for reacting to a potential intake are 
suggested in Table 5‐9. The intent of these notification levels is to provide guidance for field 
response to any potential intake of radioactive material with a potential for a dose 
commitment that is >100‐mrem CED. Table 5‐10 suggests notification levels to the 
occupational medicine physician for possible early medical intervention in an internal 
contamination  event.  These tables,  derived  from  Carbaugh  et al. (1994),  are based  on general 
considerations and significant experience with past intakes of radioactive material and, 
because they are based on field measurements, do not correspond with any exact dose 
commitmen t to the worker.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

The decision to administer treatment and the treatment protocol are solely the  
responsibilities  of the physician  in charge.  The basic  principle  is that the proposed  intervention 
should do more good than harm (Gerber and Thomas, 1992).  
 
Guidelines for the medical intervention of a radionuclide intake can be found in several 
publications. The Guidebook for the Treatment of Accidental Internal Radionuclide 
Contamination of Workers (Gerber and Thomas, 1992) contains detailed guidance in 
intervention and medical procedures useful in mitigating radiation overexposures. The CEC/DOE Guidebook has been based on the ALI for action levels, rather than on CED, to overcome the problem of uncertainties in dose per unit intake. The ICRP recommends in 
Publication  60 (1991b)  a limit  of 2‐rem/y  (20‐mSv/y)  on effective  dose  (ICRP,  1991a).  Thus,  the 
ALIs found in ICRP Publication 61 and used in the Gerber and Thomas (1992) noted above are 
those which would provide a CED of 2‐rem/y instead of current U.S. regulations of 5‐rem/y 
(Gerber and Thomas, 1992).  
 
Guidance  in the CEC/DOE Guidebook  can be summarized  as follows:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
134  
  
a. When  the estimated  intake  is below  1 ALI, treatment  should  not be considered.  
 
b. When the estimated intake is between 1 and 10 times the ALI, treatment should be 
considered. Under these situations, short‐term administration will usually be 
appropriate,  except for intake  of materials  poorly  transported  from  the lung (Type  S). 
 
c. When the estimated intake exceeds 10 times the ALI, then extended or protracted treatment should  be implemented,  except for materials  poorly  transported  from  the 
lung.  
 
d. For poorly  transported  material in the lung,  lung lavage  is the only  recommended 
treatment, and it is only a consideration for intakes exceeding 100 times the ALI.  
 
Because the dose associated with the ALI in the Gerber and Thomas (1992) is 2‐rem CED and 
because  the upper  administrative  control  level  suggested  by DOE‐STD‐1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) is 2 
rem, intervention levels of 2 rem  and 20 rem  might be used for guidance in the manner 
presented in the Gerber and Thomas (1992):  
 
a. When  the CED estimated  intake  is below  2 rem, treatment is not generally 
recommended.  
 
b. When the CED for an estimated intake is between 2 rem  and 20 rem , treatment 
should  be considered.  Under  these situations,  short‐term  administration  will usually 
be appropriate.  
 
c. When  the CED for an estimated  intake exceeds  20 rem, then  extended  or protracted 
treatment is strongly recommended, except for poorly transported material in the 
lung.  
 
A useful method to enhance excretion of uranium via the kidneys is the formation of 
radionuclide  complexes  using sodium  bicarbonate.  This type  of complexation  appears  to be 
the only current method that has a reasonable chance of reducing or preventing kidney 
damage during the early period after incorporation of this chemo ‐toxic heavy metal.  
 
An initial prophylactic chelation therapy may be appropriate because bioassay measurements 
(particularly urinalysis) cannot usually be completed within the response time required for 
effective chelation therapy. Urinalysis becomes very helpful following ad ministration of 
chelation therapy because there is a direct correlation between urinary excretion and dose 
averted because of uranium excreted. This provides a method of measuring the effectiveness 
of chelation  therapy  and determining if it is worthwhile  to continue  therapy.  It is probable  that 
the efficacy of treatment will decrease with continued administration as uranium is removed  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
135  
 and the rate of transfer into the systemic  compartment  decreases.  
 
5.9 Response  to Suspected Intakes  
 
Experience has shown that most intakes of uranium are accidental. Uranium facilities and 
operating procedures are designed to prevent intakes. Nonetheless, it is important for 
management  to prepare  for the possibility  that workers  might  receive  an intake  of uranium‐‐ 
even  though  the probability  of an incident  may  be very  small.  Prompt  and appropriate  action 
following an accidental intake of uranium will allow for therapeutic measures to be taken to minimize the internal contamination  and lessen the potential for harmful effects.  The health 
physicist and medical staff should work closely to ensure that the proper course of action is 
followed.  
 
All employees suspected of having received an intake of uranium should be referred for 
special bioassay  measurements.  Because  a fraction  of an intake  by inhalation  may  be retained 
in the nasal passages for a few hours after exposure to airborne radioactive materials, any 
level of contamination on a nasal swab indicates an intake that should be followed up by a 
special bioassay measurement program. However, lack of detection  on nasal smears cannot 
be taken as evidence that an intake did not occur either beca use the nasal passages can be 
expected to clear very rapidly or, alternatively, because the worker could be a mouth‐ 
breather. Special bioassay should also be initiated if uranium contamination is found on the 
worker in the vicinity of nose or mouth.  
 
Developing specific field criteria to identify the need for medical response can be challenging. 
Inhalation  intake  estimations  based  on DAC‐hours  exposure are straightforward  and discussed 
earlier in this document.  Early  bioassay  measurement  levels  corresponding to the action  levels 
have been calculated at Hanford and are summarized in Table 5‐11. Another method is to 
develop field observation criteria (e.g., nasal smear or skin contamination criteria) which  
might imply that an action level has been exceeded. This latter approach is highly subjective with any number chosen likely to be arguable. Knowledge of facility operations, material 
forms, and past experience will likely play a key role in development of such criteria.  
 
For acute  intakes,  direct  bioassay  measurements  should  be taken  before,  during,  and after the 
period of rapid clearance of activity. Urine and fecal samples collected after known or 
suspected inhalation incidents should also be used to estimate the magnitude of the intake.  
Initial assessments  of intakes  from  contaminated  wounds  are based  primarily  on wound  count 
and urinalysis data.  
 
If a significant  intake  is indicated,  the worker  should  not return  to further  potential  exposure 
to uranium  until  the intake  has been  thoroughly  assessed  and a predictable  bioassay  pattern 
established. This is particularly important because a new intake of a very low level may 
confound the interpretation of bioassay measurements for previous intakes of uranium.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

The health  physicist  must  make  important  decisions  for prompt  action  at the site of an 
accidental or suspected intake of uranium or other radioactive materials.  Often, these 
decisions  must  be based  on limited  data.  Information  that may  be available  for initially 
estimating the amount and type of intake may include the following: 
 
a. levels  of measured  contamination  in the work  area ; 
 
b. skin contamination  levels,  affected  areas,  and whether  the skin is damaged  or 
punctured; 
 
c. wound contamination  levels ; 
 
d. chemical form  of the material involved ; 
 
e. results  of air monitoring ; 
 
f. nasal smear  activity  levels ; 
 
g. sputum  and/or  mouth  contamination . DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
137  
 The special bioassay monitoring program is initiated following a known or suspected intake. 
This information  is needed  for dose  assessment  and future  exposure  management.  The intake 
is confirmed if follow‐up bioassay measurements indicate positive measurement results.  
Additional  bioassay  measurements  may  be needed  to quantify  the intake  and provide  data  for 
determining the effective dose equivalent. The frequency of bioassay monitoring will depend 
on the specific  case to be  evaluated.  Selection of  the appropriate  sampling frequency is based 
on the previously discussed performance capabilities for workplace monitoring programs, 
consultations with internal dosimetry specialists, and the cooperation of the affected 
employee.  
 
5.9.1 Emergency  Action  Planning  
 
The management at the uranium facility should be prepared to follow an emergency action plan  for response  to a uranium intake. If a worker  accidentally  inhales or ingests uranium or is 
injured by a uranium‐contaminated object, the action plan should be initiated immediately. A 
rapid response is important because any delay in implementing appropriate action could 
lessen  the effectiveness  of decorporation  therapy  and increase  the probability  for internalized 
uranium to deposit in the kidneys or on bone surfaces.  
 
5.9.2 Medical  Emergency  Response  Plan  
 
The health physicist and medical staff must establish an emergency action plan for the 
appropriate  medical management of an accidental intake  of uranium.  The elements  of the 
plan should include the following:  
 
a. Decision  levels  for determining when  monitoring  data  or accident  events  require 
emergency medical response;  
 
b. Responsibilities  of the affected  worker,  health  physicist,  medical staff,  and 
management or supervisory personnel ; 
 
c. Instructions  for immediate  medical  care,  decontamination,  monitoring,  and longer‐ 
term follow‐up response ; 
 
d. Provisions  for periodically  reviewing,  updating,  and rehearsing  the emergency  action 
plan.  
 
The sequence and priority of the emergency action plan may vary with the magnitude and 
type of accidental conditions and their severity. An initial early assessment of the incident 
should focus, first, on treatment of life‐threatening physical injuries and , second, on the 
radioactive  contamination  involved.  Minor  injuries  should  be treated  after decontamination.  
 
A rapid  estimate  of the amount  of internal contamination  by uranium  or other  alpha  emitters  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
138  
 may not be possible. If a significant intake (meaning one that exceeds 10 times the ALI) is 
suspected,  medical staff  should  proceed  with  decorporation  therapy  after first treating  major 
injuries.  
 
5.9.3 Responsibilities  for Management  of Internal  Contamination  
 
Responsibilities should be assigned for action in response to an accidental internal uranium 
contamination. The affected worker has the responsibility to inform the health physicist, 
radiological control technician (RCT), or his immediate supervisor as soon as an intake is 
suspected. The health physicist or RCT should make an initial surve y of the extent of the 
contamination and immediately contact his supervisor and, when action levels are exceeded, 
contact  a member  of the medical staff.  Monitoring  and radiation  safety  support  to the medical 
staff and supervisors should continue during the  management of the contamination incident. 
Care should be taken to limit the spread of radioactive contamination.  
 
The health physicist should immediately begin to gather data on the time and extent of the 
incident. Contamination survey results should be recorded. Radionuclide identity, chemical 
form, and solubility classification should be determined. Nasal smears sho uld be obtained 
immediately  if an intake  by inhalation  is suspected.  When  action  levels  are exceeded,  all urine 
and feces should be collected and labeled for analysis. Decontamination should proceed with the assistance of the medical staff. Contaminated clothing and other objects should be saved 
for later analysis.  
 
5.9.4 Immediate  Medical  Care  
 
The medical staff should provide immediate emergency medical care for serious injuries to 
preserve the life and well‐being of the affected worker. Minor injuries may await medical 
treatment  until  after an initial radiation  survey  is completed  and the spread  of contamination 
is controlled. However, the individual should be removed from the contaminated radiation 
area as soon as possible. Chemical contamination and acids should be washed immediately 
from the skin to prevent serious burns and reactions.  
 
A chel ating agent should be administered by a qualified medical professional immediately 
following an accidental intake of uranium if the dose thresholds discussed in Section 5.9 (2 
rem‐20 rem) are exceeded. Sodium bicarbonate should be available for treating int ernal 
uranium  contamination.  The worker  to be treated  must  first be informed  of the proposed  use 
of a chelating agent, instructed on the purpose of administering the chelating agent, and warned about the possible side‐effects. The worker must then g ive signed consent before 
chelation therapy may be initiated. Even though sodium bicarbonate therapy is the only 
method available for reducing the quantity of uranium retained in the body, the affected 
worker has the right to refuse its use.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
139  
 The recommended therapy for decorporation is a systemic administration of 250 mL of 
isotonic (1.4%) solution of sodium bicarbonate by slow intravenous injection (Gerber and 
Thomas, 1992). The sodium bicarbonate reacts with uranyl ions, UO 2 ++, in body fluids to form 
an anionic  complex,  probably  UO 2(CO 3)3, which  is rapidly  excreted  in urine.  Treatment may  be 
continued if bioassay indicates that decorporation therapy continues to enhance the urinary 
excretion  of uranium.  However,  if treatment is extended  over  the days  following  the incident, 
the dosage should be adapted to prevent contraindications of alkalosis (bicarbonate solution 
is alkaline) and respiratory acidosis (Gerber and Thomas, 1992).  
 
5.9.5 Contaminated Wounds  
 
Medical treatment for contaminated wounds may include flushing with saline and decorporating solutions, debridement, and surgical excision of the wound. These measures 
are all the responsibility  of trained  medical staff operating  under  the direction  of a physician. 
Radiological control personnel can provide valuable assistance by prompt assessment of 
materials removed from the wound and identification of magnitude of residual activity as 
decontamination  proceeds.  Decontamination  should  continue  until  all radioactivity  has been 
removed or until risk of permanent physical impairment is reached.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
140  
 6 EXTERNAL  DOSIMETRY  
The external  dosimetry  program  is an integral part of the external  dose  control  program.   DOE 
G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) provides detailed guidance for implementing an 
external dosimetry program that meets the requirements of 10 CFR Part 835. The reference 
section of that Guide lists specific documents applicable to external dosimetry. Because the requirements and recommenda tions are explicitly given in these documents, they will not be 
discussed in any great  detail in this chapter.  Rather, the em phasis will be on items that  are 
unique to uranium facilities and the radiological aspects for safe handling of uranium.  
 
Measuring the external  radiation exposure and the resultant dose is complicated  by the many 
radiations involved in uranium handling. Chapter 2 of this Technical Standard discusses the radioactive decay schemes for and radiations emitted by the uranium isotopes and their radioactive daughter products. Uranium has a wide distribution of beta and gamma energies, 
with  a 2.29‐MeV  beta  as the most  significant  of these.  The dose  rate from  photons  is relatively 
low. Uranium also emits alpha particles that may generate ~2 MeV neutrons as a result of interactions with the nuclei of fluorine or other low‐Z atoms. The magnitude of the neutron 
fluence depends on the enrichment of the uranium and on the interacting chemical.  
 
The elements  of the external  dose  control  program  are: detection  and characterization  of the 
beta, gamma, and neutron radiation fields; measurement and quantification of these fields; 
measurement of personnel dose; and determination and establishment of dose control 
practices.  
 
6.1 DOSE  LIMITS  
 
10 CFR Part 835 specifies  the applicable  limits  used  for control  of external  radiations.  Table  6‐1 
lists the appropriate depths in tissue for measurement  of doses to the whole body, lens of the 
eye, "unlimited areas of skin," and extremities.

(mg/cm2)

6.1.1 Limiting  Quantities  
 
In 1994,  the ICRP  introduced  a major  revision  in recommended  radiation  protection  practice 
with the introduction of ICRP Publication 60 (1991a). The new methodology expands on a 
"risk‐based" system of dose limitation. The ICRP introduced the terms stochastic and DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
141  
 deterministic  for radiation effects and set limits for both types of effect. Stochastic effect is 
defined as one for which the probability of the effect occurring (as opposed to the degree or 
severity of effect) is a function of radiation dose. Deterministic effect is d efined as one for 
which the severity of the effect is a function of the dose; a threshold may exist. Limits were established  such  that the risk of stochastic  effects  occurring  was equivalent  to about  the same 
risks faced by workers in "safe" industries who were not occupationally exposed to radiation in the workplace. Limits were also established for deterministic effects that prevented these 
effects from occurring even if the exposure occurred at the annual limit over the lifetime of 
the work er. 
 
Equivalent  dose  (HT), which  is the absorbed  dose  averaged  over  tissue or organ  due to 
radiation, is given by the equation:  
 
HT = LwR DT,R 
R 
Where:  
WR is the radiation  weighting factor  (See  Table  6‐2) 
DT,R, is the average  absorbed dose  (rad)  in a tissue or organ  
 
The equivalent  dose  is not always  the appropriate  quantity  for use in relations  to deterministic 
effects because the values of radiation weighting factors (w T) have been chosen to reflect the 
relative biological effectiveness of the different types of energies of radiation in producing 
stochastic effects.

The Effective  dose  (E) is the summation  of the products  of the equivalent  dose  received  by 
specified tissues or organs of the body and the appropriate tissue weighting factor (w T). 
Effective  dose  is expressed  in terms  of rem (or Sv).

Where:  
WT is the tissue weighting factor  (See  Table  6‐3) 
HT is the equivalent dose in rem (or Sv)

extrathoracic airways (15), small intestine (640), kidneys (310), muscle  
(28,000), pancreas (100), spleen (180), thymus (20), and uterus (80). The equivalent dose to the remainder tissues (H
remainder ), is normally calculated 
as the mass‐weighted mean dose to the preceding ten organs and tissues. In those  cases  in which  the most  highly  irradiated  remainder tissue or organ 
receives the highest equivalent dose of all the organs, a weighting factor of  
0.025 (half of remainder)  is applied  to that tissue or organ  and 0.025 (half 
of remainder) to the mass‐weighted equivalent dose in the rest of the remainder tissues and organs to give the remainder equivalent dose.  
 
For the case  of uniform  external  irradiation  of the whole  body,  a tissue 
weighting factor (w T) equal to 1 may be used in determination of the 
effective dose.  
 
Table 6‐4 lists the annual radiation dose limits for DOE activities. However, DOE contractors 
usually  establish  lower  annual  administrative  control  levels,  typically  500 mrem/year or less. 
 
In practice, it is difficult to measure the effective dose equivalents specified in Table 6‐4 
because  it is necessary to know  not only  the type  of radiation  but also its energy  and direction. 
If the flux, energy, and direction of incidence are known, it is possible to calculate effective 
dose equivalent using fluence to effective dose equivalent conversion coefficients presented  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
143  
 in ICRP Publication 51 (1987), which presents the effective dose equivalent as a function of 
energy  for various  irradiation  geometries.  Conversion  coefficients for mono‐directional beams 
of neutrons can be found in an article by Stewart et al (1994). Conversion coefficients for 
photons in various irradiation geometries, including planar sources, can be found in a report 
by Zankl et al. (1994). This approach will provide more accurate  values of effective dose 
equivalent, as opposed to numerically setting the  value of effective dose equivalent equal to 
dose equivalent geometries. Conversion coefficients for mono‐directional beams of neutrons 
can be found in an article  by Stewart  (Stewart  et al. 1994).  Conversion  coefficients  for photons 
in various irradiation geometries, including planar sources, can be found in a report by Zankl  
et al. (1994). This approach will provide more accurate values of effective dose equivalent, as opposed to numerically setting the value of effective dose equivalent equal to dose  
equi valent.

 6.1.2 Operational  Quantities  
 
Because  of the difficulties  in determining effective dose  equivalent  from  direct  measurements, 
the concept of operational quantities has been introduced to be more closely related to 
measurable quantities. Operational quantities include ambient dose equivalent used for area 
monitoring and personal  dose  equivalent  used  for personnel  dosimetry.  Operational quantities 
are designed to  be a  conservative  estimator  of effective dose  equivalent, i.e., the values  of the 
operational quantities will be equal to or higher than the effective dose equivalent specified 
for the limiting quantities.  
 
The ambient  dose  equivalent,  H*(d), is the  dose  equivalent  at a depth, d,  in a 30‐cm‐diameter 
sphere  of tissue, where:  a) the radiation  field  has the same  fluence  and energy  distribution  as 
the point of reference for the measurement; and b) the fluence is unidirectional (i.e., the 
sphere can be viewed as being in an aligned radiation field). Most survey instruments are 
designed to measure ambient dose equivalent, and international standard s are based on the 
ambient dose equivalent concept. The depth of interest is typically  1 cm of soft tissue, as 
specified in 10 CFR Part 835.  
 
The personal  dose  equivalent,  Hp(d), is the dose  equivalent  in soft tissue  at the appropriate 
depth, d, below a specified point on the body. Obviously, personnel dosimeters should be calibrated in terms of personal dose equivalent.  
 
In reality, most instruments and personnel dosimeters used at DOE facilities are calibrated in terms of equivalent dose. For example, consider the case in which personnel neutron dosimeters  are calibrated  on acrylic  plastic  phantoms  at a specified  distance  from  a calibrated 
neutron source. For DOELAP testing, the dose equivalent at this point has been calculated in accordance with ICRP Publication 74 (1996).  
 
In most  instances,  the present  methods  based  on dose  equivalent  overestimate effective dose 
equivalent. In cases where personnel are approaching dose limits, it may be prudent to more 
accurately evaluate effective dose equivalent using special calibrations. Depending on the 
irradiation geometry and energy, effective  dose equivalent may be as much  as a factor of two 
less than dose equivalent.  
 
6.2 RADIATIONS IN URANIUM  FACILITIES  
 
As outlined  in Section  2.0 of this Technical  Standard,  the uranium  isotopes  are primarily  alpha‐ 
emitters and their progeny emit a wide variety of radiations, including alpha and beta 
particles,  as well as more penetrating x  rays and gamma  rays.  Alpha‐neutron  interactions  (and 
the small cross‐section for spontaneous fission) add the potential for neutron exposure  to the 
radiation mix. This section outlines methods to calculate the dose equivalents from radiations 
emitted by uranium and its progeny. Examples of measured dose rates are also included.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
145  
 The design  of an external  dose  control  program,  including instrument  and dosimeter  selection, 
is dependent upon the type and intensity of the radiation fields to which the workers will be 
exposed. Many factors can affect the radiation field:  
 
a. Enrichment  (mix  of uranium  isotopes) ; 
 
b. Emissions from  parent  radionuclide(s) ; 
 
c. Emissions from  daughter  radionuclide(s) ; 
 
d. Emissions from  impurity  radionuclide(s) ; 
 
e. Type  of radiation  emitted  (e.g.,  beta,  gamma) ; 
 
f. Energies  of emitted  radiation ; 
 
g. Specific  activity  of the source  material;  
 
h. Self‐shielding  of source  material;  
 
i. Shielding provided  by process  equipment ; 
 
j. Shielding provided  by personal protective equipment ; 
 
k. Distance  and geometry  factors . 
 
The ratio  of uranium  isotopes  in a specific  process  (a function  of enrichment)  will determine 
the source  term  by which  the radiation  fields  can be predicted.  This mix of uranium  isotopes 
and daughter radionuclides may be estimated by using an equation developed to predict 
specific activity as a function of enrichment.  
 
Radiation fields from uranium are frequently dominated by contributions from daughter product or impurity radionuclides. For example, nearly all of the beta radiation field from depleted  uranium  comes  from  the daughter  radionuclide  
234mPa,  and to a lesser extent  from 
234Th. During melting and casting operations, these daughter elements may concentrate on 
the surface of the castings and equipment, producing beta radiation fields up to 20 rad per hour.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

bremsstrahlung peak in the low energy ranges).  
 
6.2.1 Alpha  and Beta  Doses  
 
Uranium  is an alpha‐emitter and is of concern  if inhaled  or ingested  into the body.  The skin is 
an effective  barrier to alpha particles,  and contamination  is only  a problem  if there  is a wound 
or break in the skin.  
 
Beta radiation fields are usually the dominant external radiation hazard in facilities requiring 
contact work with unshielded forms of uranium. Figure 6‐1 gives the estimated beta dose 
rates from a semi‐infinite slab of uranium metal of various enrichments . For uranium 
enrichments  up to 30%,  the beta  radiation  field  is dominated  by contributions  from  238U decay 
products. Thus, for uranium of these enrichments, one is dealing essentially with 2.29‐MeV 
(Emax) beta particles from 234mPa, the most energetic contributor to the beta exposure.  
 
Beta doses to the skin, extremities, and (sometimes) the lens of the eye can be limiting in 
facilities that process unshielded depleted, natural, or low‐enrichment uranium. Absorbed 
dose rates as a function of depth were measured by Plato (1979) with an extrapolation 
chamber in a tissue equivalent medium (Mylar) (See Figure 6‐2). Skin doses at less than 4 
mg/cm2 resulting  from  alpha particles  are of no concern  from  an external  radiation  exposure 
standpoint. Potentially significant skin exposure from uranium  occurs primarily from the 
234mPa betas at tissue depths of 4 mg/cm2 and greater.  
 
Processes  that separate  and sometimes  concentrate  beta‐emitting  uranium  daughters  are not 
uncommon in DOE uranium facilities. Surface beta dose rates on the order of 1 to 20 rad per 
hour have been observed in such circumstances. Exposure control is complicated by the fact  
DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
149  
 that considerable contact work takes place in facilities that process uranium metal. Beta 
particles are shielded by rubber gloves or other protective devices or are usually absorbed 
within  the dead  layer  of skin.  The actual  beta  dose  to live  tissue  would  depend  on the energy 
of the beta particles and the thickness and types of intervening shielding.  
 
The data  in Figure  6‐3 were  obtained  with  a tissue  equivalent  plastic  scintillation  detector  and 
demonstrate the spectral changes and the resultant exposure rates under typical protective 
clothing.  It can be seen  from  Figures  6‐2 and 6‐3 that significant  fractions  of the uranium  beta 
radiation will penetrate typical protective clothing worn in facilities which process uranium.  
 
6.2.2 Gamma  Doses  
 
Gamma radiation from uranium is normally not the controlling challenge to radiation protection. For example, the contact beta radiation field from depleted uranium is 
approximately  240 mrem/h,  while  the contact  gamma  radiation  field  is less than  10 mrem/h. 
Although gamma radiation fields from uranium are not usually the dominant concern, 
significant gamma fields can exist in areas where large quantities of uranium are stored.  
Bremsstrahlung from the 2.29 MeV 
234mPa beta can contribute up to 40% of the photon dose 
from  uranium  metal.  Neutron  fields  from  enriched  uranium  fluoride  compounds  can also add 
to this area of concern. Care should be taken that dose‐equivalents  from such fields are kept 
to levels that are ALARA.  
 
Although beta radiation fields from unshielded uranium tend to present the most intense radiation  problem,  storage  of large  quantities  of uranium  can create  widespread,  low‐level  (<5 
mrem/h) gamma radiation fields. Such fields can create ALARA problems‐‐particularly when 
significant numbers of people must work in adjacent areas.  
 
6.2.3 Neutron  Dose  Equivalents  
 
In uranium processes that create fluoride compounds (e.g., UF 4, UF 6), the a‐n reaction with 
this light nuclide can result in neutron radiation fields, the intensity of which are a function of 
the compound,  mixing,  storage  configuration,  and enrichment.  As indicated  in Section  2.0, low 
enriched UF 6 (< 5%) in large storage containers can result in neutron radiation in the 0.2 
mrem/h range, while highly enriched (> 97%) UF 6 can create fields in the 4 mrem/h range. At 
high enrichments, the neutron fields can be up to a factor of 2 higher than the gamma fields 
and be the limiting source of whole body exposure. Neutron radiation from uranium metals 
and low enriched compounds is  considerably lower than the gamma component and, 
consequently, is not limiting.  
 
Neutron dose equivalent  rates can be calculated accurately with computer codes, such as the 
Monte  Carlo  Neutron  Program  (MCNP)  (Brie smei ster, 1986).  The MCNP  code  has the 
advantage that it can calculate both neutron and photon doses through shielding and in 
complex arrays. The Monte Carlo codes can also calculate the effects of neutron multiplication 
in systems  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
150  
 containing large  amounts  of uranium.  However,  neutron  dose  equivalent  rates  can also be 
calculated from simple empirical formulas. Unlike gamma doses, there is very little self‐ 
shielding for neutrons in sub‐kilogram masses of uranium.  
 
Table 6‐5 lists spontaneous fission yields for uranium isotopes that may be found in facilities within the DOE complex. These data are taken from NUREG/CR‐5550 (NRC 1991) and are believed to be more current then the previously published PNL values (Backenbush et al., 
1988). As a rule of thumb, nuclides with even numbers of protons and neutrons have the 
highest spontaneous fission neutron emission rates. The spontaneous fission rate for odd‐ even nuclides is about 1000 times less, and the rate for odd‐odd nu clides is about 100,000 
less. Spontaneous  fission  neutrons  are emitted  with  a Maxwellian  energy  distribution  given  by 
the equation:  
 
 
N(E) = √E * exp(E/ 1.43 MeV ) ; 
 
Where N(E)  is the number  of neutrons  as a function of the energy  E in MeV.

Energetic  alpha  particles  can overcome  coulomb  barriers  in low‐atomic‐number  elements  and 
create  an unstable  nucleus  that emits  neutrons.  Because of the high  alpha  activity  of uranium, 
this can be a significant source of neutrons. There are two nuclear reactions that are of importance:  
 
∝ + 180 → 21Ne + n  
 
∝ + 19F → 22Na +  n 
 
Table  6‐6 lists the alpha‐neutron yields  for oxides  and fluorides  for the uranium  isotopes. Note 
that the neutron yields  are normalized per  gram  of nuclide, not per gram  of compound. These 
data are taken from NUREG/CR‐5550 (NRC 1991).  
 
The total  neutron  yield  per gram  of uranium  can be found  by summing the contributions  from  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
151  
 a. Spontaneous  fission  (from  Table  6‐5) 
 
b. Alpha‐neutron  reactions  in oxides  or fluorides  (from  Table  6‐6) 
 
c. Neutrons  from  low‐atomic‐number  impurities  (from  Table  6‐7) 
 
Multiplying  the specific  neutron  yield  (neutrons  per second  per gram  (nps/g)  of uranium  by 
the mass of uranium (grams) gives S, the neutron emission rate (neutrons per second).  
 
In order  to sum  the three  contributions,  it is necessary  to convert  the values  in Table  6‐7. 
 
The specific  activity  of U‐234  is converted  from  Ci/g to disintegrations  per second  per gram 
(dps/g):  
 
6.2x10‐3 Ci/g x 3.7x1010 dps/Ci  = 2.3x108 dps/g.  
 
Now  we set (for Be): 106 disintegrations  = 44 neutrons  
 
2.3x108 dps/g  x 44 neutrons/106dis ≈ 104 nps/g

6.3 RADIATION  DETECTION  AND  EVALUATION  
 
This section describes the response of portable instruments, personnel dosimeters, and 
nuclear  accident  dosimeters  to the radiations  emitted  by uranium,  which  are primarily  alpha 
and beta particles and photons. Neutron emissions may range from negligible to significant. 
Data are also included on special spectrometry instruments used to calibrate dosimeters in the field.  
 
6.3.1 Portable  Survey  Instruments‐‐Beta  Radiation Response 
 
The primary  exposures  of concern  when  handling bare  uranium  materials  come  from  the beta 
radiation. The accuracy and precision of survey instruments used for measurement of beta 
radiation fields depend upon some or all of the following factors: 
 
a. beta  energy  response  
 
b. angular response  of instrument  
 
c. sour ce‐detector  geometry  factors  
 
d. detector  construction  (e.g.,  window  thickness)  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
153  
 6.3.1.1  Energy  Dependence  
 
Most commercially‐  available radiation survey instruments under‐respond to beta radiation 
fields from uranium. Figures 6‐4 and 6‐5 show the beta and gamma spectra measured with a 
tissue  equivalent  plastic  scintillation.  Table  6‐8 presents  typical survey  instrument  response  to 
uranium fields specifically. At best, typical "beta correction factors" (true dose rate/indicated dose rate) are on the order of 1.5 to 2. This under‐response is due primarily to a) the angular 
response  of the detector and b) attenuation of the dose‐rate  by the detector window and the 
sensitive volume of the detector.

Currently,  skin dose  measurements  are related  to the dose  at a depth  of 7 mg/cm2 in tissue. 
Window thicknesses of commonly available survey instruments typically range from on the 
order of 7 mg/cm2 to several hundred mg/cm2. 
 
Even if the window provides only minimal attenuation, the attenuation of the beta field through  the sensitive volume  of large  detectors  remains  a problem.  The detector  indicates  the 
average dose‐rate throughout the sensitive volume. The "true" dose‐rate is that which occurs 
at the plane of the detector incident to the radiation source. The instrument will under‐ 
respond  by the ratio of this average dose‐rate to the incident dose‐rate. This sensitive volume 
under‐response is a function of the beta energy distribution and of the size and shape of the 
sensitive volume.  
 
6.3.1.2  Angular  Response  
 
The construction of most survey instruments (e.g., "cutie pie") leads to a severe angular dependence  when  measuring beta  radiation  fields. This angular dependence  results  from  the 
attenuation  of the beta field by the walls of the detector as the window is moved away from 
the source.  
 
Figure  6‐6 demonstrates  the response of a tissue equivalent  response  (a 5 mg/cm
2 detector  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
155  
 under a 5 mg/cm2 window and mounted in a TE phantom) to off‐axis (non‐incident) 90Sr/90Y 
betas  (energies  similar to those from  uranium),  204Tl, and 147Pm. Skin tissue  dose  response  is 
greater to off‐axis betas; survey instruments, which effectively shield these high angle 
particles, will under‐respond compared to skin tissue.

Beta Particles from Three Standard Beta Sources.  
 
 
6.3.1.3  Source‐Detector  Geometry  
 
Measurements taken close to small beta sources may be inaccurate due to non‐uniform 
irradiation of the sensitive volume of the detector. Uranium in most DOE facilities tends to 
present  wide‐area sources  of beta  radiation.  However,  adjustments  would  need  to be made  if 
significant non‐uniform irradiation was encountered.  
 
6.3.1.4  Detector  Construction  and Use 
 
Characteristics of  instrument construction  may  significantly affect their  response  and use. For 
example, many survey instruments have "beta windows" that are intended to discriminate between beta and gamma radiation. Obviously, measurements of beta dose‐rate must be 
made  with  the beta  window  open.  It should  be noted,  however,  that a number  of instruments 
have beta windows that are only a few hundred mg/cm
2 thick. Such windows can transmit a 
significant fraction of the dose‐rate from high‐energy beta‐emitters (e.g., 234mPa). Thus, up to 
10% or 20% of the "gamma only" reading may be due to the higher‐energy betas penetrating 
the so‐called beta window.  
DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
156  
  
Occasionally,  survey  instruments  are placed  in plastic  bags  or covered  to protect them  from 
becoming contaminated. Bagging the instrument places additional absorber between the 
radiation field and sensitive volume of the detector. Calibration of the instrument (or 
application of a correction factor) should take this additional shielding into  account.  
 
6.3.2 Portable  Survey  Instruments‐‐Gamma  Radiation Response  
 
Although  the external  dose  resulting  from  gamma  and x‐ray  radiation  from  bare  uranium  is a 
small fraction of the total, it represents the "penetrating" or whole body dose source and is 
the only source of radiation from contained facilities (i.e., those having glove boxes). Survey instruments are typically calibrated with 
137Cs (0.662‐MeV) photons. Typical portable survey 
instruments demonstrate a fairly flat energy response above 250 keV, while the response below 250 keV can be variable to a greater or lesser degree depending upon the instrument 
design. Figures 6‐ 7 and 6‐8 show average response of a group of commercial survey 
instruments. Figure  6‐9 shows  a typical gamma spectrum  from  a uranium  oxide  source  while 
Table 6‐9 illustrates the wide variation that can occur in the photon spectra at various 
locations in a single plant. This demonstrates the desirability of using ion chambers or 
compensated beta instruments for dose‐rate measurements. It also indicat es the need to 
have knowledge of the energy response of the instrument used and the value, or at least 
qualit ative knowledge, of the photon spectra at the various workstations.

6.3.3 Portable  Survey  Instruments‐‐Neutron Response  
 
The need for neutron surveys at uranium facilities depends on the quantity of uranium 
present, its form, and the potential for (α,n) reactions, such as occurs with uranium fluoride. In facilities where such monitoring is required, selection of instruments with appropriate 
energy  characteristics  is important  because  of the energy  and angular dependence  with  most 
instruments. Fortunately, uranium compounds emit neutrons in the MeV range, where 
problems with energy and angular dependence are minimal. Calibrati on with sources that 
emit neutron energies similar to those in the facility will assist in accurately measuring the radiation fields and selecting appropriate factors in calculating personnel doses.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
159  
 6.4 PERSONNEL  DOSIMETRY  
 
It is important to verify and document that personnel dosimetry systems provide accurate 
measurements and records of the occupational radiation doses received by workers in 
uranium facilities. To provide a level of confidence in dosimetry services in DOE facilities, the 
DOELAP accreditation program has been established. 10 CFR Part 835 requires participation in the DOELAP program (or specific exceptions or other approvals) by all DOE facilities that are 
subject to the individual e xternal dose monitoring requirements. Previously, the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established the National Voluntary Laboratory 
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for testing and accreditation of dosimeter processors serving 
the commer cial nuclear power industry and medical facilities. The DOELAP standard includes 
some tests that differ from those in ANSI  N13.11‐ 2022 (2022a ), on which the NVLAP program 
is based. Both DOELAP and NVLAP accreditation programs use performance tests that 
evaluate the  accuracy  and precision  of personnel  dosimetry  measurements.  The accuracy  is 
determined by comparing the measured dose equivalent to the "conventionally true dose 
equivalent" derived  from calibration  standards  directly  traceable to  NIST  in carefully  
controlled  conditions.  
 
DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) provides detailed guidance for developing and 
implementing an external dosimetry  program  that will comply  with  the requirements  of 10 
CFR Part 835.  This section will focus on dosimetry problem areas specific to uranium facilities 
and possible solutions.  
 
Personnel  dosimeters  produce  the data  that become  the formal or "legal"  record  of personnel 
exposure. However, these detectors experience many of the same energy dependence and 
angular response problems encountered by survey instruments. The most difficult problem is relating badge results to the shallow or skin dose.  
 
Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), currently the dosimeter of choice in most DOE uranium  facilities,  provide  the most  accurate  and precise  means  of measuring  doses  received 
by workers.  Film  badges and  nuclear  track  detectors are other types  of dosimeters. Although 
the following discussion focuses on the more widely used TLD detector systems, the basic 
principles apply to film badges, with the added uncertainties associated with the increased 
susceptibility of film to environmental influences, su ch as temp erature, humidity, pressure, 
etc. Great care is necessary to ensure that the shallow and deep doses are accurately 
discriminated and measured.  
 
An ideal dosimeter would directly measure doses at 7, 1000, and perhaps 300 mg/cm2 
(shallow, deep, and lens of eye doses). In practice, the dose at such depths in tissue must be 
inferred  from  a combination  of measurements  with  different  filters.  TLD and film elements  are 
mounted in a badge arrangement, which is covered by at least 10 to 30 mg/cm2 of Mylar, 
paper, or other covering for mechanical and/or protective reasons.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
160  
 6.4.1 Energy  Dependence  
 
Personnel dosimeters are beta energy‐dependent for the same reason that survey 
instruments are beta energy‐dependent. That is, the reading obtained from the dosimeter is 
proportional to  the average  rate of energy  deposition  through  the "sensitive volume"  or body 
of the element.  If this average  energy  deposition  is less than  the deposition  at 7 mg/cm2, then 
the dosimeter will under‐respond.  
 
TLD chips of lithium fluoride (0.32 cm x 0.32 cm) are about 240 mg/cm2 thick. Significant 
attenuation  of the beta  field  takes  place  through  the body  of the chip.  As a result,  these types 
of TLD chips under‐respond to uranium decay betas by a factor of about 2.  
 
Other  TLD systems minimize  this problem  by adhering  a thin layer  of TL powder  onto  a plastic 
backing. Current TLD personnel dosimeters typically use multiple detectors (typically, four) 
under different filter thicknesses. The different responses of each element are used as input 
to an algorithm  which  provides  an estimate of the effective  radiation  energy  and the doses  at 
depths of interest.  
 
Detectors  that are very  thin minimize  energy‐dependence.  Film  detectors  demonstrate  a high 
energy‐response dependence for low‐energy photons, as well as beta energy‐response dependence (though the beta response is less variable than that of TLD chips).  
 
Current  systems could potentially provide  accurate  and precise information;  however,  their 
complexity can lead to problems. Calibration of these systems should be performed by a person  with  specific  expertise in the detector’s  system  and knowledge  of badge  response  to 
high beta or mixed beta and gamma radiation fields.  
 
6.4.2 Angular  Dependence  
 
The dosimeter elements must be mounted in a badge or element holder. The assembled 
badge usually displays severe angular dependence. Fortunately, in most cases, a worker’s 
normal movements will tend to average out some of this dependence. Some badge holder 
arrangements  can flip the badge  completely  over  so that the "beta  window"  of the badge  is 
facing the worker, not the source. The design of the badge holder or strict administrative 
controls should be utilized to minimize this problem.  
 
6.4.3 Dosimetry  Practices  
 
Beta  and gamma  fields  in working  areas  should  be well‐characterized.  See previous  figures 
and tables as examples. An attempt should be made to correlate survey instrument and 
dosimeter badge  results.  Badge  reading  frequency  should  be long enough  to accumulate a 
significant  dose  (100‐mrem  range)  and short  enough  to allow  adequate  control.  Dosimeter 
change frequencies can vary with the specific work‐site conditions.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
161  
  
Although multiple badging is not usually necessary, it should be considered for use in very 
high  beta  fields  produced  by separated  uranium  decay  products.  The dosimetry  system  used 
shall meet or be specifically excepted from DOELAP standards (10 CFR § 835.402(b)) and be 
specifically designated for measuring both shallow and deep doses from uranium.  
 
Dosimetry  systems  should  be capable  of providing routine  results  within  a reasonable  time 
period. The system of badge collection and re‐distribution should be well defined and 
minimize the possibility of lost badges.  
 
Badge reading systems should have established "action levels" to alert technicians or 
operators of unusual results. Such results should include readings or TLD element ratios in excess  of certain  levels.  If possible,  the system  should  automatically  save  glow  curves  of any 
unusual results.  
 
The potential  for badge  contamination  should  be minimized.  Where the potential  for badge 
contamination exists, badges should be frequently checked for contamination.  
 
6.4.4 Extremity  Dosimetry  
 
Doses to the extremities from uranium processing and handling can involve significant 
exposures  to the skin of the hands  and forearms.  Doses  over  small  areas  of the skin,  including 
those from hot particles, are discussed in detail in DOE G 441.1‐ 1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) 
and will not be discussed here.  
 
Measurement of the dose to the hands and/or forearms typically are made with TLD chips or 
TL powder in finger rings or wrist dosimeters. Such devices do not allow for all of the 
sophisticated energy discrimination just discussed. The non‐homogeneity of beta radiation 
fields  coupled  with  the angular dependence of  commonly  available  extremity  dosimeters can 
result in a probability of underestimating the dose. However, by carefully considering the 
typical exposure conditions at the work site (e.g., handling metal pieces, glove box work) and  
calibrating  the dosimeters  with  appropriate  sources  (e.g.,  uranium  plaque  sources),  extremity 
doses can be measured with acceptable accuracy for protective purposes.  
 
Care should be exercised in preventing "obvious" underestimations of extremity dose. For 
example,  finger rings  worn  on the "top"  of the finger (opposite  the palm  side of the hand)  will 
not measure the dose received by the palm side when handling metal rods, etc. Dosimeters worn on the wrist have been shown to underestimate the beta dose to the fingers and palm. 
Reference to the  Bibliography information sources will  provide  further  information in current 
techniques and considerations.  
 
The general methods  used  to calibrate  dosimeters  are given in the National Bureau  of DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
162  
 Standards  Special Publication  633,  Procedures  for Calibrating Neutron Personnel  Dosimeters 
(Schwartz and Eisenhauer, 1982) . The Radiological and Environmental Laboratory (RESL) of 
Idaho Falls, Idaho conducts the performance test irradiations for the DOELAP program.  
Processors submit dosimeters for testing to the performance testing laboratories in the 
categories listed in Table 6‐10. If the dosimeter processor passes certain accuracy and tolerance testing criteria, a team of dosimetry experts visit the processor and assess the operation of the dosimetry program, including dosimetry records and data retrieval systems, 
before the dosimeter processor is certified. These requirements are given in DOE STD‐1111‐ 
2018, Department  of Energy  Laboratory  Accreditation Program  Administration  (2018a ) and its 
associated guidance documents.

163  
 At present, only personnel dosimeters for whole body irradiations are required to be tested, 
but a DOE working group developed an extremity dosimetry performance testing standard. 
Extremity dosimeters may be voluntarily tested. DOE also conducts an inter‐comparison of 
calibration sources used for radiation p rotection purposes, but in the near future DOE 
secondary  calibration  laboratories  will be established  to increase  the consistency  of radiation 
protection instrument calibrations to national standards.  
 
There is some question about the correct quality factor to apply to extremity neutron 
dosimeters. Most quality factors are defined in terms of linear energy transfer (LET), so a 
numerical  value for quality factor can be readily derived  by calculation  or measurement of the 
neutron energy spectra. However, the relationship between quality factor and LET was  
derived  from  biological  experiments  on cancer  induction,  especially  leukemia in blood‐forming 
organs. There are no blood‐forming organs in the extremities , so there is no biological basis  
for large values of quality factors for extremity exposures. However, regulatory agencies 
typically apply quality factors derived for whole‐body exposures to the extremities; thus, for 
compliance purposes, qualify factors should be applied for extremity ex posures.  
 
6.4.5 Dose  to Lens  of Eye 
 
It is sometimes assumed that if the skin dose limit is not exceeded, the dose limit to the lens  
of the eye will not be exceeded.  Such  assumptions  should  be well supported  by calculations  or 
(preferably) actual measurements. See Figure 6‐3 for data indicating significant uranium beta 
penetration of even face shields. It is suggested and is a common practice in most fabrication areas to require the use of safety glasses, a practice which tends to mitigate this concern.  
 
6.5 External  Dose  Control  
 
Reduction of personnel doses to levels that are ALARA is largely a matter of common sense 
applied to the principles of time, distance, and shielding. The first step in any dose control 
program is to adequately identify, characterize, and measure the radiat ion fields. Only after 
this step has been performed can optimum dose control be achieved for a given amount of time, money, and energy. However, other considerations may be just as important. Good housekeeping practices are vital to keep dose rates low. Ev en invisible dust layers on the 
interior surfaces of glove boxes can increase radiation fields. Storing gloves inside the glove box when  not in use and placing lightweight  "pie plate"  shields  over  the glove‐port  openings 
are examples of practices that can significantly reduce dose rates.  
 
6.5.1 Time  
 
As a general rule, a reduction in exposure time will yield a reduction in doses. Any operation 
that involves  high  dose  rates  (more  than  a few mrem/hour)  or extended  exposures  should  be 
reviewed for possible reductions in a worker’s exposure time. Traffic and material flow in proposed facilities should be closely examined for opportunities to reduce exposure time.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
164  
 6.5.2 Distance  
 
Beta dose rates from uranium and its decay products decrease rapidly with distance from the 
source due to geometry and air shielding while gamma and neutron radiation decrease less 
with distance due to scattering buildup. Because uranium facilities usually  involve a high 
percentage of contact  work,  considerable  dose  reduction  can result  from  simple  techniques  to 
make operations semi‐remote and allow workers to function. Even short distances can affect 
significant dose reductions.  
 
6.5.3 Shielding  
 
Shielding is probably the most widely used (and most effective) method of reducing beta doses from uranium. Relatively lightweight, cheap, and flexible shielding (e.g., plastic or 
rubber mats) has been used effectively. Figure 6‐3 demonstrates the spectral  basis for 
shielding and lists a few protective clothing reduction  factors.  Table  6‐11 lists the thicknesses 
of common shielding materials necessary to stop essentially all of the beta particles from uranium  (i.e., 
234mPa). Generally,  the lower  atomic  number  and less dense  shielding  materials 
are used whenever possible to eliminate bremsstrahlung as well as beta radiation fields.  
 
Protective clothing commonly worn in the nuclear industry can also afford beta dose 
reduction.  Figure  6‐3 and Table  6‐12  list approximate  dose  reduction  factors  provided  by such 
clothing. Particular attention should be paid to the use of gloves for "hands‐on" work.  
Although lightweight rubber gloves provide some reduction, consideration should be given to 
using heavy  leather  or even  leaded  gloves  for operations  that do not require  manual dexterity. 
Such gloves can be particularly effective in handling materials emitting high beta fields from unsupported uranium decay products.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

Contamination  build‐up  inside  of work  gloves  has led to unacceptable  hand doses  in some 
facilities. Re‐use of leather or cloth gloves should be reviewed carefully for such build‐up. 
Workers should wear thin, anti‐contamination gloves inside the heavy gloves.  
 
Dose  to the lens of the eye can be effectively  reduced  through  the use of ordinary  glasses,  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
166  
 safety  glasses,  or face  shields.  Such  eye protection  should  be required  when  workers  are 
dealing with the high beta fields from concentrated uranium decay products.  
 
6.5.4 Geometry  
 
The beta radiation field from uranium is strictly a surface phenomenon. Dose reduction 
programs  can take  advantage  of this fact in some circumstances.  For example,  large  plates  or 
sheets  of uranium  metal,  if stored  in racks  ’ledge  on,"  will present  less of a beta  (and  gamma) 
radiation field.  
 
6.6 Recordkeeping  
 
10 CFR Part 835 establishes  specific  requirements  for maintenance  of records  associated  with 
area and individual monitoring. DOE G 441.1‐1C Chg 1 (Admin Chg) (2011 a) and DOE‐STD‐
1098‐ 2017 (2017 b) provide guidance for achieving compliance with these requirements. 
There are no occupational radiation protection recordkeeping requirements that are unique 
to uranium facilities.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

 7 NUCLEAR CRITICALITY  SAFETY  
This chapter emphasizes present‐day criticality concerns from the standpoint of what nuclear 
criticality safety and radiological control personnel in a uranium facility need to know for the 
DOE mission to be accomplished in a safe and cost‐effective manner. It provides an overview 
of the administrative and technical elements of current nuclear criticality safety programs. It 
does  not provide  a definitive  discourse  on nuclear  criticality  safety  principles  or repeat  existing 
guidance. For radiological control personnel who require a greater understanding of nuclear 
criticality safety, the listed references provide a source of detailed requirements and 
information.  
 
Health  physicists  and other  radiation  protection  personnel  have  the technical  responsibility  to 
understand nuclear principles and the impact of these principles, in the form of the 
radiological conditions  that exist in DOE  facilities  as the result  of the processing,  handling,  and 
storage of radioactive and/or fissile materials. Radiation protection personnel provide an 
additional knowledgeable resource to help recognize workplace situations that might lead to 
the violation of a nuclear criticality control parameter that could c ontribute to an inadvertent 
nuclear criticality event. There have been occasions in which radiation protection personnel have observed and stopped unsafe actions by facility personnel that, if allowed to continue, 
might have resul ted in a nuclear criticality accident. Radiation protection personnel must also 
be aware  of the  potential impacts of  their  actions that  would be viewed  as routine  for normal 
radiation protection practice, but which could result in the violation of a nuclear criticality safety control parameter. Finally, radiation protection personnel are the focus of emergency 
response actions should an inadvertent nuclear criticality o ccur. These actions include use of 
emergency instrumentation, accident dosimetry, radiolo gical dose assessment, and recovery.  
 
This section reviews 1) nuclear criticality safety regulations and standards, including technical 
safety requirements (TSRs) applicable to DOE facilities, 2) criticality control factors, 3) past 
criticality  accidents  and associated  lessons  learned,  4) roles,  responsibilities,  and authorities  of 
radiological control staff with regard to nuclear criticality safety, and 5) the content of an 
acceptable nuclear criticality safety program.  
 
7.1 REGULATIONS  AND  STANDARDS  
 
Nuclear criticality safety program requirements for DOE facilities are presented in DOE O 
420.1C Chg 3, Facility Safety (2019 b), which requires the development of a well‐documented 
Criticality Safety Program and incorporates compliance with ANSI/ANS‐8 nuclear criticality safety standards.  ANSI/ANS‐8 standards provide guidance and criteria on good practices for 
the prevention  and mitigation  of criticality  accidents  during handling,  processing,  storing,  and 
transporting special nuclear materials at fuels and material facilities.  
 
The DOE detailed  requirements  for criticality  safety  are contained  in Attachment 2, Chapter  3 DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
168  
 of the DOE  Order  420.1C  Chg 3 ( 2019b ). Criticality  safety  requirements  support  the 
documented safety analysis required by 10 CFR Part 830, Subpart B.  
 
There are two objectives  for nuclear criticality safety in  the Order:  1) nuclear criticality safety 
is comprehensively addressed and receives an objective review, with all identifiable risks 
reduced to acceptably low levels and management authorization of the operation 
documented, and 2) the public, workers, property, both gove rnment and private, the 
environment,  and essential  operations  are protected  from  the effects  of a criticality  accident.  
 
7.2 Criticality  Control  Factors  
 
As noted  in ANSI/ANS‐8.1,  Nuclear  Criticality Safety  in Operations  with  Fissionable  Materials 
Outside Reactors (1998), nuclear criticality safety is achieved by controlling one or more 
factors of the system within subcritical limits.  
 
Control  may  be exercised  through  the following:  
 
• Administrative  procedures  (e.g.,  requiring  a mass  not exceed  a posted  limit) ; 
 
• Physical  restraints  (e.g.,  confiding a solution  to a cylindrical vessel  with  a diameter  no 
greater than a specified value below the subcritical limit) ; 
 
• Instrumentation  (e.g.,  utilize  devices  that measures  the fissile  concentration  and 
prevent its buildup in a chemical system) ; 
 
• Chemical means  (e.g.,  prevention  of conditions  that allow  precipitation,  thereby 
maintaining concentration characteristic of an aqueous solution) ; 
 
• Reliance on the natural course or credible course of events (e.g., by relying on the 
nature  of a process  to keep  the density  of uranium  oxide  less than  a specified  fraction  of 
theoretical) . 
 
7.2.1 Controllable  Factors  
Some  of the criticality  safety  controls  used  maintain  a system  in a subcritical  state  are 
described below.  
 
7.2.1.1  235U Enrichment  
 
Enriched uranium is normally required to provide sufficient fissionable material to sustain a 
critical nuclear  reaction  in a small enough  mass  to meet  the needs  of the system.  Handling of 
natural (0.7% 235U) or depleted (<0.2% 235U) uranium is generally safe at DOE uranium‐ 
processing facilities because deliberate engineering efforts, such as moderation with heavy 
water, reactor‐grade graphite, etc., are required to create a critical mass with natural DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
169  
 uranium.  However,  safe‐handling measures  should  always  be observed  when  handling 
uranium of any enrichment.  
 
7.2.1.2  Mass 
 
The minimum  mass  of uranium  that will sustain  a chain  reaction  under  specified  conditions  is 
called the critical mass. The minimum critical mass depends on 235U enrichment and other 
factors, such as the amount of moderator.  
 
7.2.1.3  Density  or Concentration  
 
Density  or concentration  is defined  as mass  per unit volume  (e.g.,  grams/liter).  A uniform 
solution or slurry less than 10.8 gm 235U /l will be subcritical at any volume, while a 
concentration four or five times greater could result in the critical mass.  
 
7.2.1.4  Moderation  and Reflection  
 
A moderator is a material that slows down fast neutrons. The most effective moderators are 
those materials having a low atomic weight, such as hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and 
carbon. The moderator concentration is usually expressed as the ratio of the n umber of 
hydrogen atoms to the number of fissionable atoms of the isotope; thus, the extent of moderation in an aqueous solution of 
235U may be expressed as the H/235U ratio. The ratio 
H/235U may range from zero for metal, or a dry unhydrated salt, to seve ral thousand for a 
dilute aqueous solution. Over this concentration range and with the assumed spherical 
geometry, the critical mass may vary from a few tens of kilograms (with little hydrogen) 
through a minimum of a few hundred grams (at optimum moderatio n) to infinity in a very 
dilute  solution  where  the neutron  absorption  by hydrogen  makes  a chain  reaction  impossible. 
A moderated and/or reflected system allows a smaller mass of 235U to become critical.  
 
A reflected system is an assembly where the fissionable material is partly or wholly 
surrounded by another material having a greater neutron scattering cross‐section than air. 
(Technically, air is a reflector, but its effect is usually negligible). In a re flected system, a 
fraction of the neutrons leaving the fissionable material (core) is reflected back into the fissionable  material where  they  may  induce  additional  fissions.  The effect  of a reflection  is to 
reduce the minimum critical mass. A good reflector is a material that has a low neutron 
absorption cross‐section. Water, concrete, graphite, and stainless steel are typically "good" 
reflectors, although any material will serve as a reflector. A "fully r eflected" system is one 
where the fissionable material is totally surrounded by a reflector such that increasing the 
reflector thickness results in little or no decrease in the critical mass. For example, 
experiments at various laboratories have shown that  increasing the thickness of water 
surrounding the fissionable material beyond 8 inches does not significantly decrease the 
critical Mass (Paxton et. al., 1986).  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
170  
 7.2.1.5  Geometry  or Shape  
 
Leakage  of neutrons  from  a system  depends  on the shape  of the system  and on the neutron‐ 
reflecting properties of surrounding materials. The shape and size of containers are 
determined by considering the ratio of surface area (S) to volume (V). The ratio S/V is 
maintained at a value that prevents a chain reaction regardless of the quantity of material 
contained.  
 
7.2.1.6  Interaction  or Arrays  
 
Interaction is the exchange of neutrons between separate containers containing uranium 
material.  An increase  in the exchanged  neutrons  increases  the fission  reaction  rate.  Units  that 
are subcritical individually can be made into a critical array if brought near each other.  
 
7.2.1.7  Neutron  Poisons  (Absorbers)  
 
Neutron absorbers (poisons) are nonfissionable materials that capture neutrons, thus 
reducing the number of neutrons available for a fission reaction. Cadmium, boron, and 
chlorine  are examples  of neutron  absorbers.  Boron  in borosilicate  glass  Raschig  rings  and 
chlorine in polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) rings are poisons used in some applications.  
 
7.2.1.8  Monitoring  for Deposits  for Nuclear  Safety  Control  
 
One concern in many older facilities is the potential for accumulation of uranium compounds in ventilation ductwork and process piping. A program must be in effect to routinely monitor 
such equipment to identify uranium compound deposits in quantities that may present 
nuclear criticality safety concerns. The need for such a program should be determined by 
nuclear criticality safety specialists, based on the enrichment of material processed (both past 
and present) and the geometry of the ductwork or piping. Such a review and survey should 
also be conducted prior to shut down and decommissioning of uranium facilities. In general, 
the use of NaI detectors, in conjunction with single or multichannel analyzers, can ofte n 
provide adequate sensitivity to determine holdup deposits. If intervening shielding reduces sensitivity  and/or  background  gamma  radiation  levels  are too great,  neutron  detectors  may  be 
effective in identifying uranium deposits, particularly for highly enriched uranium. Since the 
hold‐up measurements are generally taken in "cpm" for maximum sensitivity, it is useful to 
have a correlation from "cpm" to exposure or dose units to facilitate an understanding of the relative radiological hazard.  
 
7.2.2 Administrative  Practices  
 
Administrative  practices  consist  of personnel,  programs,  plans,  procedures,  training,  audits 
and reviews, and quality assurance practices used to administer a nuclear criticality safety 
program.  Administrative  controls  are used  in addition  to physical  design  features,  including  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
171  
 engineered controls, to ensure nuclear criticality safety. ANSI/ANS‐8.19, Administrative 
Practices for Nuclear Criticality Safety (2005) outlines administrative practices. An effective 
nuclear criticality safety program requires a joint effort by managers, supervisors, workers, 
and nuclear  criticality  safety  staff and relies  on conformance  with  operating  procedures  by all 
involved personnel. The following sections describe the key elements of a nuclear criticality 
safety program.  
 
7.2.2.1  Nuclear  Criticality  Safety  Program  
 
Management should develop a nuclear criticality safety policy and ensure it is distributed to 
fissionable material workers. They should also delegate authority to implement the policy, 
monitor the nuclear criticality safety program, and periodically partic ipate in audits of the 
program.  Supervisory  staff should  ensure  that nuclear  criticality  safety  procedures  are written 
and staff are trained in those procedures. The nuclear criticality safety staff should provide 
technical guidance for equipment and proce ss design and for operating procedure 
development. The nuclear criticality safety staff should perform a nuclear criticality safety 
evaluation before starting a new operation with fissionable materials or before changing an 
existing operation. An independe nt expert should evaluate the technical adequacy of the 
nuclear criticality safety program periodically.  
 
7.2.2.2  Nuclear  Criticality  Safety  Organization  
 
Like the  radiation  protection  program, the  nuclear criticality  safety  organization  should  report 
to the highest level of facility management independent of operations. Management should 
clearly communicate nuclear criticality safety organization responsibilities and authorities to other facility personnel. Organizational and procedural document s should clearly define lines 
of interaction and interfaces with other facility organizational components. Management 
should  assign  the responsibility  for nuclear  criticality  safety  in a manner  that is consistent  with 
other safety disciplines. The organization should also have an independent nuclear criticality 
safety review committee and have access to consultants to assist in the conduct of the 
criticality safety program.  
 
7.2.2.3  Plans  and Procedures  
 
Facility nuclear criticality safety plans and procedures are critical components of the overall 
facility operation. The purpose of procedures is to facilitate the safe and efficient conduct of 
operations. These documents provide the means by which the prog ram is conducted and 
prescribe how nuclear criticality safety is to be achieved. The plans and procedures describe administrative activities and the technical aspects of nuclear criticality safety analysis. The 
processes of procedure development, review, t raining, and approval should have sufficient 
controls to ensure that nuclear criticality concerns are properly addressed. These controls include periodically reviewing and reaffirming procedures, and properly investigating 
procedure  deviations  and reporting  them  to facility  management  and,  if appropriate,  to DOE.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
172  
 The controls  should  also ensure  such  deviations  do not recur.  
 
Procedures should exist that address the determination and posting of nuclear criticality 
safety  parameters.  These  procedures  should  include  a description  of how  the limits  are to be 
determined and how workstations are to be posted as to form, geometry controls, mass 
limits, moderator limits, etc.  
 
Management  should  provide  fire‐fighting  guidelines  to ensure  fire‐fighting  techniques  do not 
violate a criticality control limit that might lead to an inadvertent nuclear criticality event.  
These guidelines  should  include  the posting  of specific  rooms  with  acceptable  fire‐suppression 
techniques that can be used for a specific location or the use of notations on facility fire pre‐ 
plans (operating procedures) located at fire stations.  
 
Recovery  procedures  should  be in place  to provide for  the recovery  from  a nuclear  criticality 
control  limit  violation.  A limit  violation  involves  exceeding  the fissionable  material mass  limit 
or the moderator liquid limit, or violating any other criticality control in an operations 
procedure. This process should separately address both static and dynamic cases, as 
responses to these violations may be quite different.  
 
Management should develop and implement nuclear criticality safety training plans and 
procedures for all personnel working with or near fissionable materials, as required by 
ANSI/ANS‐8.20,  Nuclear  Criticality Safety  Training (1991).  This program  and its associated 
procedures describe the program, training requirements, recordkeeping, content, 
responsibilities, and objectives of a facility nuclear criticality safety program.  
 
Inspections and audits are performed to assess the success of the nuclear criticality safety 
program. Qualified individuals who are independent of the operation should perform the 
inspections and audits. The audits and inspections should verify that operat ing procedures 
and other safety standards are being followed and identify any weaknesses in the nuclear 
safety  program.  Deficiencies  should  be formally  addressed,  tracked,  reported,  and resolved.  
 
7.2.2.4  Nuclear  Facility  Safety  Analysis  
 
Documented Safety Analyses (DSA) document the analysis and potential consequences of accidents and abnormal occurrences at nuclear facilities. Per 10 CFR § 830.204 ( 2020c ), with 
respect  to a nonreactor  nuclear  facility with  fissionable  material in a form  and amount to  pose 
a potential for criticality, the DSA defines a criticality safety program that: ensures that 
operations  with  fissionable  material remain  subcritical under  all normal  and credible  abnormal 
conditions, identifies applicable nuclear criticality safety standards, and describes how the 
program meets applicable nuclear criticality safety standards.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
173  
 7.3 CRITICALITY  ACCIDENT  EXPERIENCE  
 
Criticality  accidents,  sometimes  called  criticality  excursions,  can either  be single  pulse, 
multiple pulse, or "steady state" (continuous) excursions.  
 
7.3.1 Types  of Criticality  Accidents  
 
In a pulse‐type criticality accident, there is an initial pulse of 10 16‐1018 fissions over a short 
time‐period (less than 1 second), sometimes followed by additional lower‐intensity pulses. In  
a fissionable  material solution,  the pulse  or spike  is terminated  by the heating and consequent 
thermal expansion of the solution and by bubble formation that serves to reconfigure the 
fissionable mass into a noncritical configuration (Paxton, 1966). If the initial pulse results in a 
loss of solution from the container (e.g., by splashing)  or redistribution of material, the 
criticality event may conclude without further pulses. However, if there is no loss of material 
as the solut ion cools, it may form a critical mass once again and pulse with slightly lower 
fission yield.  
 
Criticality  accidents  can result  in lethal doses  of neutron  and gamma  radiation  at considerable 
distances from the accident site (on the order of tens of meters). There can also be high level 
beta‐gamma residual radiation levels from fission products after the excursion is concluded. The heat generated during the excursion can melt parts of the system that contain the 
fissionable material (Moe 1988).  
 
Moe reviewed estimated prompt radiation doses from excursions in a moderated system and 
a metallic system, as well as dose rates from residual contamination left by a criticality 
excursion. Assuming a burst of 1018 fissions in an unshielded, water‐moderated system, the 
total  absorbed  dose  is estimated  to be >600 rad up to 6 m and >100 rad up to about  15 m. The 
gamma/neutron ratio of the total absorbed dose was 2.8. An excursion of 3 x 1015 fissions in a 
metallic, partially reflected 239Pu assembly, assuming  no shielding, yielded total absorbed 
doses of >600 rad up to approximately 10 m and >100 rad up to approximately 25 m. The 
gamma/neutron  absorbed dose  ratio  was 0.1. In general,  for a moderated system, the gamma 
dose would be expected to be higher than the neutron dose and, for a metal system, the 
neutron dose would be expected to be higher than the gamma dose.  
 
Moe (Moe 1988)  noted that  for an excursion  of >1018 fissions,  dispersion  of the fissionable 
material and fission products would occur, resulting in heavy local contamination and subsequent  high  residual dose  rates.  This dose  rate was estimated  at >1000  rad/h  at 100 ft 
shortly after the burst and >10 rad/h at 30 ft an hour after the burst. This is the basis for 
instructing workers to immediately run from the work area when the criticality alarm is 
sounded. Seconds can save significant dose, if not from the e xcursion itself, then from any 
residual radiation that is in the area.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
174  
 7.3.2 Summary  of Past  Criticality  Accidents  
 
Current criticality safety practice has been influenced both by the overall experience of the 
nuclear industry  and by the  analysis  of the accidental  criticality  excursions  that have  occurred. 
Los Alamos National Laboratory has published LA‐13638, A Review of Criticality Accidents 
(McLaughlin et al., 2000) which provides a description of 60 criticality accidents. According to 
LA‐13638,  there have  been  22 criticality  accidents  in chemical process  facilities.  Twenty‐one  of 
the 22 occurred with fissile material in solu tions or slurries, one occurred with metal ingots.  
No accidents  occurred  with  powders.  
 
Overall,  the consequences  from  the 22 accidents  have  been  9 deaths,  3 survivors  with  limbs 
amputated, minimal equipment damage, and negligible loss of fissionable material. One of 
these incidents  resulted  in measurable  exposure to the general public  (well  below  allowable 
worker annual exposures). All accidents have been dominated by design, managerial, and operational failures. The focus for accident prevention should be on these issues.  
 
7.4 CRITICALITY  ALARMS  AND  NUCLEAR  ACCIDENT  DOSIMETRY  
 
Guidelines  for criticality  alarm  systems  and nuclear  accident  dosimetry  are presented  in this 
section. Criticality alarm systems provide rapid warning to individuals in the immediate 
accident location and nearby locations to evacuate to a predesignated assembly location.  
Specific requirements for the criticality alarm system are found in ANSI/ANS‐8.3, Criticality Alarm System (1997) . Key requirements that may be of interest for the radiological control 
staff are summarized in Section 7.4.1. Paxton noted lives have been saved in past criticality 
accidents by radiation alarms coupled with effective evacuation procedures. Nuclear accide nt 
dosimetry,  discussed  in Section  7.4.2,  provides  the means  for determining the dose  to workers 
in the vicinity of the excursion.  
 
7.4.1 Criticality  Accident  Alarm  System  (CAAS)  
 
As specified in ANSI/ANS‐8.3 (1997), the need for a CAAS shall be evaluated for all activities in which  the inventory  of fissionable  material in individual unrelated  work  areas  exceeds  700 g of 
235U, 520 g of 233U, 450 g of 239Pu or 450 g of any combination of these three isotopes.  
 
a. If the fissionable  material mass  exceeds  the ANSI/ANS‐8.3  limits  and the probability  of 
criticality is greater than 10‐6 per year, a CAAS shall be provided to cover occupied 
areas in which the expected dose exceeds 12 rad in free air. Nuclear accident dosimetry shall also be provided, as otherwise required. The CAAS should include a 
criticality detection device and a person nel evacuation alarm.  
 
b. If the fissionable  material mass  exceeds  the ANSI/ANS‐8.3  limits  and the probability  of 
criticality is greater than 10‐6 per year, but there are no occupied areas in which the 
expected dose exceeds 12 rad in free air, then only a criticality detector system (i.e.,  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
175  
 nuclear  accident  dosimetry)  is needed.  
 
c. If the fissionable material mass exceeds the ANSI/ANS‐8.3 limits, but a criticality 
accident  is determined  to be impossible  or less than  10‐6 per year (per a Documented 
Safety Analysis), then neither a criticality alarm nor nuclear accident dosimetry is 
needed.  
 
The alarm  signal shall be for immediate  evacuation  purposes  only  and of sufficient  volume  and 
coverage to be heard in all areas that are to be evacuated. Information on sound levels of the 
alarm can be found in ANSI/ANS‐8.3 (1997). The alarm trip point shall be set low enough to 
detect the minimum accident of concern. The minimum accident of co ncern may be assumed 
to deliver the equivalent of an absorbed dose in free air of 20 rad  at a distance of 2 meters 
from the reacting material within 60 seconds. The alarm signal shall activate promptly (i.e., within 0.5 second) when the dose rate at the detectors equals or exceeds a value equivalent  
to 20 rad /min at 2 meters from the reacting material. A visible or audible warning signal shall 
be provided at a normally occupied location to indicate system malfunction or loss of primary 
power. Each alarm system should be tested at least once every three months.  An evacuation 
drill shall be conducted at least annually.  
 
Criticality accident alarm systems may consist of one to several detectors per unit. In multi‐ 
detector  units  (e.g.,  three  detectors),  at least  two detectors  shall be at the alarm  level  before 
initiating the alarm; in redundant systems, failure of any single channel  shall not prevent the 
CAAS from functioning.  
 
7.4.2 Nuclear  Accident  Dosimetry  
 
Nuclear accident dosimetry shall be provided for installations that have sufficient quantity of 
fissionable  material such  that the excessive exposure  of individuals  to radiation  from  a nuclear 
criticality accident is possible (10 CFR § 835.1304(a)).  
 
Requirements  for nuclear  accident  dosimetry  programs  at DOE facilities  are found  in 10 CFR 
Part 835. A nuclear accident dosimetry program shall include the following:  
 
a. a method  to conduct  initial screening of individuals  involved  in a nuclear  accident  to 
determine whether significant exposures have occurred ; 
 
b. a system of fixed nuclear accident dosimeter units. Sometimes referred to as area 
dosimeters,  the dosimeters  should  be capable  of yielding  estimated  radiation  dose 
and the approximate neutron spectrum at their locations ; 
 
c. personal  nuclear  accident  dosimeters  (PNADs) ; DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
176  
 d. methods  and equipment  for analysis  of biological  materials  (such  as 24Na activity  in 
blood and 32P activity in hair) . 
 
7.4.2.1  Initial Screening Evaluation  
 
A nuclear  accident  dosimetry  program  should  provide  absorbed  dose  information  within  24 
hours after the incident. A method should be established for immediately identifying 
individuals exposed to total absorbed doses exceeding 50 rad (ANSI N13.3‐2013, 2013b).  
Discussions on initial screening evaluations  to segregate exposed  from  unexposed  individuals 
(sometimes referred to as "quick sort techniques") are found in several references (Moe, 
1988; Delafield, 1988; Petersen and Langham, 1966; Hankins, 1979; Swaja and Oyan, 1987).  
 
A common initial screening method is to provide all workers in areas requiring nuclear 
accident  dosimetry  with  an indium  foil in their  personnel  dosimeter  or security  badge.  During 
a criticality excursion, the foil will become activated by neutrons per the 115In (n, gamma) 
116mIn reaction and can be measured with a portable beta‐gamma survey instrument or ion 
chamber. The 116mIn has a 54‐minute half‐life and releases a 1‐MeV beta (maximum energy) 
and a 1.3‐MeV gamma (80% of the time).  
 
An alternate screening is to measure body activity due to neutron activation of the sodium in 
the blood  via the 23Na(n,  gamma)24Na reaction.  Sodium‐24  has a 15‐hour  half‐life  and releases 
a 1.4‐MeV beta (maximum energy) and two gammas (1.37 MeV and 2.75 MeV). A beta‐ 
gamma survey meter is used to measure the 24Na activity in the blood by placing the detector 
probe  against  the individual’s  abdomen  and having the individual  bend  forward  to enclose  the 
detector (Moe 1988). Alternatively, the probe can be positioned under the armpit with the 
open window facing the chest area. Moe (1988) noted this method is less sensitive than the 
use of indium foils and even a small reading can indicate a significant exposure. An 
approximate equation to calculate worker dose (D) based on body weight and instrument 
reading is shown in the following Equation:  
 
 
 
 
 
Differences in incident neutron energy spectrum, orientation, and measurement techniques 
relative  to conditions used to develop activity‐dose correlations can cause significant errors in 
estimated radiation dose based on quick‐sort surveys. Swaja and Oyan (1987) showed radiation doses estimated from induced body activity can vary by a factor of approxi mately 2 
because of neutron energy spectrum or orientation effects and by as much as 30% due to 
probe  position.  Doses  based  on indium  foil activity  can vary  by a factor  of approximately  9 due 
to neutron energy spectrum effects, a factor of 3 depending on foil orientation relative to the 
incident field, and a factor of approximately 2 due to probe window setting. Swaja and Oyan 
(1987) recommended those count rates above background during qui ck‐sort techniques  
DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
177  
 should  be initially  interpreted  only  as an indication  that the person  has been  exposed.  
 
7.4.2.2  Fixed  and Personnel  Nuclear  Accident  Dosimeters  
 
A comprehensive nuclear criticality dosimetry system should consist of stationary (fixed‐ 
location,  area)  dosimeters,  neutron  and gamma  dosimeters  worn  by personnel  (i.e.,  PNADs), 
and specialized laboratory equipment to evaluate the dosimeters.  
 
Fixed nuclear accident dosimeter units should be capable of determining neutron doses in the 
range of 10 rad to 10,000 rad with an accuracy of ±25%. They should also be capable of providing the approximate neutron spectrum to permit the conversion of rad to rem. The 
gamma‐measuring component of  the dosimeter should be capable of measuring doses in the 
range of 10 rem to 10,000 rem in the presence of neutrons with an accuracy of about ±20%. 
The number  of fixed  dosimeter  units  needed  and their  placement  will depend  on the nature  of 
the operation, structural design of the facility, and accessibility of areas to personnel.  
Generally, dosimeters should be placed so there is as little intervening shielding and as few 
obstructions as possible. The number and placement  of dosimeters should be periodically re‐ 
verified  to reflect  changes  in building design  and operations.  Ease  of dosimeter  recovery  after 
a criticality event should be considered in their placement, including the possible need for 
remote retrieval.  
 
PNADs  should  be worn  by all individuals  who  enter  a controlled  area,  with  locations  requiring 
an installed criticality alarm system. The PNADs should be capable of determining gamma 
dose  from  10 rad  to 1000 rad  with an  accuracy of  ±20%  and neutron  dose  from 1  rad to 1000 
rad with an accuracy of ±30% without dependence upon fixed‐unit data.  
 
The general criteria of ANSI  N13.3‐2013 (2013b)  for nuclear  accident  dosimeters  are reviewed 
below. Dosimeters, both fixed and personnel, should be protected against radioactive contamination to avoid false measurements. Periodic inventory methods should be 
established and audits made to ensure the dosimeters are not removed or relocated without 
appropriate  approvals.  Techniques  for estimating  the effect  of body  orientation at  the time of 
the exposure should also be developed.  
 
• Neutron‐Measuring Component of Dosimeter. Criticality accidents create a wide range 
of neutron energies. Since the neutron dose per unit fluence is strongly dependent on 
neutron energy, knowledge of the neutron energy spectrum is important in accident 
dosimetry. In criticality accidents, neutrons with energies greater than 100 keV contribute  most  of the dose;  therefore,  measurement  of the fast neutron  dose  is of the 
most importance. See Delafield (Delafield 1988) for a review of the different types of 
neutr on dosimeters available for accidents.  
 
• Gamma‐Measuring  Component  of Dosimeter.  Delafield  noted  the ratio  of the gamma  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
178  
 rays to neutron  dose  will vary  according  to the type  of critical assembly  and whether  or 
not additional shielding is present. For unshielded assemblies, the gamma‐to‐neutron 
ratio can range from 0.1 for a small heavy‐metal system up to approximately 3 for a 
small hydrogen‐moderated solution system. A concrete or hydrogenous shielding 
material will increase  the gamma‐to‐neutron  ratio.  Gamma  dose  can be determined  by 
TLD, film, or radiophotoluminescent glass.  
 
• Dosimeter Comparison Studies. Sims and Dickson (Sims and Dickson, 1979; Sims, 1989) 
present  a summary  of nuclear  accident  dosimetry  intercomparison  studies  performed  at 
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Health Physics Research Reactor. The more recent summary showed that of the 22 studies conducted over 21 years, 68% of the neutron 
dosimeter results were within the 
±25% accuracy standard and 52% of the gamma 
dosimeter results were within the ±20% accuracy standard. Most measurements that 
failed to meet the accuracy standards overestimated the actual dose. Some of their 
other findings include the fol lowing:  
 
o Doses  from  hard  neutron  energy  spectra  are more  accurately  measured  than  those 
from soft energy spectra.  
 
o The threshold detector unit (TDU) is the most accurate type of nuclear accident 
neutron  dosimeter;  however,  its use is declining  due to increasingly  strict  control  of 
small quantities of fissionable materials.  
 
o Activation  foils (ACT)  are the most  popular  nuclear  accident  neutron  dosimeter.  
 
o For gamma  dosimeters,  TLDs  are the most  popular  and the least  accurate,  and film 
is the least popular and the most accurate.  
 
7.4.2.3  Biological Indicators  
 
Earlier in this section, a quick‐sort method was described that uses neutron activation of 
sodium in the blood as an indicator of worker exposure. More sophisticated laboratory 
analysis of blood samples can be performed to obtain a more accurate estimate of worker 
dose (Delafield, 1988; Hankins, 1979). The use of neutron activation of sulfur in hair 
(32S(n,p)32P) is another method to estimate absorbed dose for workers involved in a criticality 
accident.  The orientation  of the subject  can also be determined  by taking  samples  of hair from 
the front  and back  of the person.  Hankins  described  a technique  for determining neutron  dose 
to within ±20‐30% using a combination of blood and hair activations. Th e evaluation was 
independent of the worker's orientation, of shielding provided by wall and equipment, and of 
neutron leakage spectra.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
179  
 7.5 RESPONSIBILITIES  OF RADIOLOGICAL  CONTROL  STAFF  
 
The radiological control staff should have a basic understanding of program structure, 
engineering criteria, and administrative controls as related to nuclear criticality safety and 
reviewed in earlier sections of this chapter. However, the health physicist's primary 
responsibilities  with  regard  to nuclear  criticality  safety  include  emergency  instrumentation 
and emergency response actions.  
 
7.5.1 Routine  Operations  
 
During routine operations, the radiological control staff’s primary responsibility related to 
nuclear criticality safety will include calibrating, repairing, and maintaining the neutron criticality alarm detectors and nuclear accident dosimeters, and maint aining appropriate 
records. The radiological control staff should be knowledgeable of criticality alarm systems, 
including alarm design parameters, types of detectors, detector area coverage, alarm set‐ 
points,  and basic  control  design.  The staff should  also be familiar with  locations  and scenarios 
for designing the fixed nuclear accident dosimetry program and formulating plans for 
emergency response.  
 
The radiological control  staff  should  maintain  an adequate  monitoring  capability  for a nuclear 
criticality accident. In addition to the criticality alarm systems and the fixed nuclear accident 
dosimeters discussed above, remotely operated high‐range gamma instruments, personal alarming dosimeters for engineering response/rescue teams, neutron‐monitoring 
instrumentation (in case of a sustained low‐power critical reaction), and an air‐sampling 
capability for fission gases shall be maintained.  
 
Other support activities may include assisting the nuclear criticality safety engineer or operations  staff  in performing  radiation  surveys  to identify  residual  fissionable  materials 
remaining in process system or ventilation ducts.  
 
7.5.2 Emergency  Response  Actions  
 
The priorities of the radiological control staff during a criticality event should be to rescue 
personnel, prevent further incidents or exposures, and quickly identify those who have been 
seriously  exposed.  To support  these  emergency  response  actions,  the radiological control  staff 
should be trained in facility emergency procedures. These emergency procedures include 
evacuation  routes,  personnel  assembly  areas,  personnel  accountability,  care  and treatment  of 
injured and exposed persons, means for immediate identification of exposed individuals, 
instrumentation for monitoring the assembly area, and re‐entry and formation of response teams.  
 
Emergency  response  procedures  for conducting the initial quick‐sort  of workers  should  specify 
measurement techniques and require that surveyors record methods and instrument settings  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
180  
 used for quick‐sort operations to ensure proper interpretation of the results. 
Surveyors/analysts  should  compare  field  results  to pre‐established  activity‐dose  relationships 
developed as part of emergency response procedures to determine if a worker was exposed. 
Other indicators, such as a discharged self‐reading dosimeter, could also indicate a possible 
exposure.  
 
As an immediate follow‐up action on  workers  identified as  being exposed  during a quick‐sort 
procedure, a more accurate dose estimate should be made using PNADs, fixed‐location 
accident dosimeters, or biological activity analyses (24Na in the blood or 32P in the hair). The 
more accurate analyses should include: 1) better definition of source characteristics, 2) location  of moderating  materials,  and 3) location  and orientation  of the person(s)  at the time 
of exposure  and action  of the person  following  the irradiation.  If the radiological  control  staff 
are involved in the rescue and initial monitoring procedures, they can provide valuable information to support this analysis, particularly regarding the location and orientation of 
workers  to the excursion.  
 
Radiological control staff should be responsible for retrieving fixed nuclear accident 
dosimeters  and ensuring that PNADs  from  any exposed  workers  are submitted  for analysis.  
 
7.5.3 Special  Considerations  during  Decommissioning  Activities  
 
Before  decommissioning or disposal  of any facilities  or equipment,  an evaluation  should  be 
performed to assess the potential holdup of fissionable material in any equipment. These types of measurements may require the assistance of radiological control staff.  
 
Some strippable coatings and surface‐fixing films are effective neutron moderators. Nuclear 
criticality  safety  specialists  should  be consulted  when  using these  coatings  to decontaminate 
surfaces because criticality could be a concern, depending on the geometry of the removed 
coating when in the disposal unit.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
181  
 8 WASTE  MANAGEMENT  
A material  is a waste  once  there  is no identified  use or recycle  value  for it. Normally,  wastes 
are considered by their physical form as either solids, liquids, or gasses, except that 
containerized liquids are considered solid waste under some of the current regulations.  
Although these forms are each processed differently, there are interrelationships. For 
example, it may be possible to reduce solid waste by replacing disposable protective clothing 
with reusable clothing that must be laundered. The laundry will produce liq uid waste. In 
treating liquid waste, solids may be generated, e.g., filters or ion exchange resins. By careful 
engineering,  waste  generation,  and treatment  alternatives,  a site can minimize  the total  waste 
volume and elect to generate types of waste that c an be disposed of. The following sections 
address potentially contaminated waste and waste terminology and handling of airborne 
waste, solid waste, and liquid waste. The treatment of excess materials to reclaim uranium is 
not a waste treatment process and is not discussed here.  
 
The Atomic  Energy  Act, 1954,  as amended,  categorizes  uranium  as source  material (natural)  or 
as special nuclear material (enriched).  For this reason , uranium is exempted from regulation  
by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 40 CFR § 261.4(a)(4).  However, if 
these materials are mixed with other wastes, they may be subject to RCRA.  For this reason, it 
is important to prevent comingling, mixing, dissolving, etc. of uranium with hazardous waste.  
 
8.1 POTENTIALLY  CONTAMINATED  WASTES  
 
Wastes are generated within a plant or facility as a consequence of creating the uranium 
product(s) for which the plant was designed. Uranium may be entrained in the air, may 
contaminate  equipment,  materials,  or other  scrap,  or may  be contained  in low concentrations 
in liquid wastes and effluents. Wastes resulting from operation of a uranium facility may 
include radioactive, nonradioactive, and mixed materials in the form of liquids and gaseous 
effluent or solids requiring disposal.  
 
Uranium  recovery  operations  and processes  are an operational  feature  of most  major  facilities 
handling large quantities of material for at least two major purposes, i.e., to salvage valuable material and to reduce effluent concentrations and volumes to acceptable levels.  
 
The facility and all waste systems must be designed to minimize wastes that result in the release of radioactive materials, during normal plant operation, the occurrence of a Design 
Basic  Accident  (DBA)  meeting  the regulatory  limits,  and conditions  in which  dose  is kept as low 
as reasonably achievable. Waste systems include retention containers, cleanup systems for 
liquids and solids, and analytical equipment.  
 
Accounting for waste  management for solid  and liquid  wastes  is discussed  below.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
182  
 8.1.1 Solid  Waste  
 
Facilities should provide for the safe collection, packaging, inventory, storage, and 
transportation  of solid  waste  that is potentially  contaminated  with  radioactive  materials.  Such 
provisions include adequate space for sorting and temporary storage of solid waste, 
equipment  for assay  of the waste,  and facilities  for volume  reduction  appropriate  to the types 
and quantities  of solid  waste  expected.  All packages  containing potentially  contaminated  solid 
waste should be appropriately monitored, both before being moved to temporary storage 
locations and before being loaded for transport to a disposal site.  
 
8.1.2 Liquid Waste  
 
Industrial wastes such as discharge from mop sinks, overflow from positive pressure circulating waste systems, and process steam condensate (if existing) should be analyzed, collected and transferred to a liquid waste treatment plant or similar treatment area if 
mandated  by the chemical analysis.  Provisions  should  be made  for continuous  monitoring  and 
recording of radioactivity, flow volume, and pH. The radioactivity monitor should have an 
alarm located in the liquid waste treatment plant or area. Consideration should be given to 
retention systems.  
 
Liquid process wastes should be collected and monitored near the source of generation 
before batch transfer through appropriate pipelines or tank transfer to a liquid waste 
treatment  plant  or area.  These wastes  should  be individually  collected  at the facility  in storage 
tanks that are equipped with stirrers, sampling and volume‐measuring devices, and transfer 
systems. Waste storage tanks and transfer lines should be designed and constructed so that 
they are fully inspectable and that any leakage can be detected an d contained before it 
reaches the environment.  Consideration of nuclear criticality (See previous section) is 
necessary to prevent accidents.  
 
Sanitary wastes include the nonradioactive wastes usually found at a facility, e.g., discharges 
from non‐contaminated chemical laboratories, showers, and lavatories. The sanitary waste 
system and the uranium‐handling area should not be connected. Sanitary sewers should 
discharge  into an onsite,  approved  sanitary‐sewage  treatment system.  Current  Federal,  state, 
and local codes regarding the discharge of sanitary wastes must be met.  
 
8.2 DESIGN  OF WASTE  PROCESSING  SYSTEMS  
 
Process  system  designs  may  be characterized  by their  design  objectives  and the effluents  of 
concern.  
 
8.2.1 Objectives  
 
A principal design  objective  for process  systems  is to minimize  production  of wastes  at the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
183  
 source.  One of the primary  design  objectives  of any Waste  Management  Program  is to provide 
facilities and equipment to handle the wastes generated and further reduce the amounts and 
volume of the waste. Volume‐reduction facilities and equipment for liquid and solid wastes 
are required,  as is air filtration  to reduce  the concentration  of contaminants  in the air effluent.  
 
8.2.2 Effluents  
 
Airborne  and liquid  effluents  released  uncontrolled  to the environment  are of particular 
concern  when  societal  emphasis  on environmental  pollution  control  is high.  Process  and 
monitoring equipment are critical to maintaining acceptable operations.  
 
Effluents (both radioactive and nonradioactive) from the uranium‐handling facility include air 
and other gaseous exhausts and liquid wastes. The contamination in the effluents should be 
kept ALARA, commensurate with best available technology at the time of  design. Emphasis 
should be placed on reducing total quantities of effluents (both radioactive and nonradioactive) released to the environment. Filter systems should be designed so that the 
effluent concentrations of uranium should not exceed the inhaled a ir Derived Concentration 
Standard (DCS) for releases, as described in DOE‐STD‐1196‐ 2022, Derived Concentration 
Technical Standard ( 2022b ) for uncontrolled areas measured at the point of discharge (e.g., 
exhaust ducts and stacks) during normal operations. Consideration should be given to 
recirculation systems for process ventilation where feasible. Provisions should be made for 
retention  systems for liquid  effluents.  All effluent  streams  should  be sampled  or monitored  as 
appropriate to ensure accurate measur ements of all releases under normal and DBA 
conditions.  
 
8.3 Treatment  
 
The following  sections  provide  information  about  treating  airborne,  liquid,  and solid  wastes.  
 
8.3.1 Airborne  Wastes  
 
Ventilation  control  systems  within  a plant  are designed  to move  air from  outside  "clean"  areas 
to process areas and then to air‐cleanup systems. Occupied area off‐gas systems are also vented to the atmosphere and may have cleanup systems of their own. Process off‐gas treatment systems consist of any or all of the following:  
 
Wet scrubbers  are generally  used  in dusty  process  off‐gas  situations,  in which  large  amounts 
of uranium are present. The scrubbers are capable of removing and processing large quantities and serve as a prefilter to the remaining cleanup units.  
 
Prefilter systems  other  than  the wet scrubber  are bag filters  or other  rough/coarse  filters.  The 
prefilters are used  to remove  significant quantities of particulate material from the  air off‐gas 
and are generally  placed  before  high‐efficiency  particulate  air (HEPA) filters  in order  to extend  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
184  
 the life of the more  expensive filters.  
 
HEPA filters generally are the final filter in the process off‐gas and serve to reduce the 
particulate  effluent  to insignificant  or permissible  levels.  They  may  be placed  in series  to 
provide  the required  filtering  efficiency.  See section  8.3.3  for disposition  of HEPA  filters.  
 
8.3.2 Liquid Waste  
 
Because  liquid  effluents  are generally  released  to the environment,  liquid  wastes are  of equal 
concern with airborne wastes. Liquid effluents become available for dispersion and 
reconcentration  in food  chains  and may  otherwise  result  in population  exposure  potential.  In 
the case of liquid wastes, the concern for chemical pollutants is generally of equal concern to 
that of radiological contaminants. Liquid  process wastes are  generally  collected  in hold tanks, 
monitored, processed or treated, and released.  
 
Hold tanks are used to collect liquid effluent prior to release in order that analyses can be 
performed  to establish  that the concentrations  or total  quantities  are below  permissible  levels 
prior to release. The liquid can be processed or treated to remove radioactive material or neutralize chemicals.  
 
Settling  basins  are frequently  used  to provide  a means  of reducing effluents  further  before 
releasing them to offsite areas.  
 
Filtration is a simple method of removing insoluble particulate materials entrained in the 
liquid  streams.  For some  processes,  it is an effective  and inexpensive  method.  The particulate 
material collected and filter must be periodically removed and treated as solid waste.  
 
Ion exchange is a cleanup system for removing soluble ions from the liquid streams by 
collecting  the material on resin  columns.  The contaminants  must  be periodically  removed  by a 
regeneration process and the materials processed, concentrated, etc., or by replacing the 
resin completely and treating it as solid waste.  
 
Conversion to solid forms is a function of nearly all the processes mentioned which converts 
the materials  removed  from  the liquid  and airborne  waste  streams  to more  manageable  forms 
for handling and permanent disposal.  
 
8.3.3 Solid  Waste  
 
Solid  waste  come  from  a variety  of sources  in the plant  from  machining chips  to contaminated 
clothing.  The solid  wastes  should  be concentrated  (if possible  and/or  practical), packaged,  and 
stored on the plant site for an interim time period prior to permanent disposal. Careful 
documentation  is necessary  to establish:  a) quantities  and nature  of the waste  being  disposed, 
and b) compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and other  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
185  
 disposal  and shipping/handling requirements.  
 
Onsite  volume‐reduction  facilities,  such  as incinerators,  compactors,  or chemical  leach  from 
metallic waste sources, can result in volume reduction in the range of 1 to 400 or more.  
 
8.4 Monitoring  
 
Monitoring the airborne effluents is an important aspect of control and documentation. 
Monitoring should be done in the stack at the discharge point and at the boundary of the 
uncontrolled area. In addition, total activity discharged and total mass of uranium discharged 
should be determined and documented to ensure that concentration requirements are not 
exceeded.  If stack  monitoring cannot  be performed  (e.g.,  in instances  where  the facility  design 
is such that there are no stacks), then the reason for the monitoring method selected should 
also b e documented.  
 
Monitors are of two general types: continuous and passive. Continuous monitors are 
constructed with a radiation detector which is placed in a shielded container such that it 
"views" the activity as it is being collected on a filter from a sample of the stack effluent. The 
continuous level of radioactivity on the filter is recorded and set up in such a way that preset levels  trigger  an alarm.  This type  of monitor  is less sensitive  but provides  an alarm  in the event 
of mishap or equipment failure in time to t ake effective mitigating action.  
 
Passive monitors consist of a continuous (isokinetic, if practical) sample collected of the effluent in the stack. The filter is periodically removed  and submitted to radiological  and/or 
chemical analyses.  The sensitivity  or level  of detection  is lower  for passive  sampling  systems 
than for continuous stack samplers, and provide after‐the‐fact information only.  
 
8.4.1 Air and Gaseous  Effluents  
 
All air and other gaseous effluents from confinement areas should be exhausted through a 
ventilation system designed to remove particulates. All exhaust ducts (or stacks) that may 
contain  fissile  contaminants  should  be provided  with  two monitoring systems.  One should  be 
of the continuous type (CAM) and the other a passive sampler. These systems may be a 
combination unit. The probes for sampling purposes should be designed for isokinetic 
sampling and located according to good industrial hygiene practices. The design of effluent 
monitoring systems should appropriately meet the  requirements of ANSI N42.18‐2014, 
Specification and Performance of Onsite Instrumentation for Continuously Monitoring 
Radioactive Effluents (2014b). Nuclear criticality safety should be considered  in the design of 
equipment used to treat and clean up radioactive gaseous effluents.  
 
8.4.2 Liquid Effluents  
 
Emphasis  should  be placed  on reducing total  quantities  of liquid  effluents  released  to the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
186  
 environment. The contamination in the effluents should be ALARA, commensurate with the 
latest accepted technology at the time of design. All effluent streams should be sampled or 
monitored,  as appropriate,  to ensure  accurate  measurement of all releases  under  normal and 
DBA conditions. The design of effluent monitoring systems should appropriately meet the 
provisions of ANSI N42.18‐2014 (2014b).  
 
8.4.3 Water  Collection  System  
 
Collection systems should be considered and provided where practical for water runoff from nuclear facilities containing radioactive material, such as from firefighting activities. Nuclear 
criticality, confinement, sampling, volume determination, and retrievability of liquids and 
solids  should  be required  in the design of  collection  systems.  The size of the collection  system 
for firefighting water should be based on the maximum amount of water which would be 
collected in fighting the Design Basis Fire (DBF) . The configuration of the system components 
should  be based  on conservative  assumptions  as to the concentration  of fissile  material which 
might collect in  the system.  Recirculating  systems should  also be considered  when  there is no 
possibility of contamination.  
 
For special facilities  that process,  handle,  or store  uranium,  the water  runoff  collection  system 
should be designed with the following nuclear criticality safety considerations: 1) the 
maximum uranium mass loading that could be in the runoff system; 2) the most disadvantageous uranium concentrations, particle size, and uranium dispersion in the  water 
slurry; and 3) the change in concentration of uranium and geometric configuration of the slurry as the uranium settles out of the water.  
 
8.5 Waste  Minimization  
 
Uranium facilities shall have a waste‐minimization and pollution prevention program (DOE, 2011). The objective of such a program is the cost‐effective reduction in the generation and 
disposal of hazardous, radioactive, and mixed waste. The preferred method  is to reduce the 
total  volume  and/or  toxicity  of hazardous  waste  generated  at the source,  which  minimizes  the 
volume  and complexity  for waste  disposal.  It is necessary  to minimize  the generation  of RCRA 
mixed waste because of the difficulty and cost of later separation.  
 
The waste minimization program applies to all present and future activities of the facilities that generate hazardous,  radioactive,  and/or  mixed  wastes.  Furthermore,  waste  minimization 
is to be considered for all future programs and projects in the design stages, and should be 
included in all maintenance and/or construction contracts.  
 
All managers  of facilities  or activities  that generate  hazardous,  radioactive,  and mixed  waste 
are responsible for:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
187  
 • minimizing  the volume  and toxicity  of all radioactive,  hazardous,  and radioactive  mixed 
waste generated, to the extent economically practicable,  
 
• preparing  and updating waste  minimization  plans  for their  waste‐generating  facilities  or 
activities (small waste generators in a larger facility may be grouped with others in a 
facility or activity plan),  
 
• implementing  the facility‐specific  or activity‐specific  waste  minimization  plan,  
 
• providing input  to the organization  responsible  for waste  characterization  and 
minimization, to support the waste minimization program,  
 
• communicating waste  minimization  plans  to their  employees,  and ensuring that 
employees receive appropriate training,  
 
• ensuring that existing  system/equipment  replacement  or modification  is designed  and 
installed to minimize generation of waste,  
 
• developing new  waste‐minimization  strategies  and identifying  cognizant  staff for waste 
minimization communications between facility personnel, and  
 
• identifying  new  waste‐generating  facilities  or activities  and significant  process  changes 
to existing facilities or activities to the waste characterization and waste‐minimization organization.  
 
Waste volume control, or waste minimization, involves limiting the amount of material that 
becomes contaminated, segregating clean and contaminated material, and prolonging the 
useful  life of equipment  and material to minimize replacement.  Sometimes, materials  can be 
completely  cleaned  so that disposal  as non‐radioactive  solid  waste  (or refurbishment  in clean 
areas) is an option.  
 
Program  design  decisions  can affect  uranium  waste  generation.  For example,  the quantity  of 
protective clothing may be a significant factor. If an incinerator is available, combustible 
protective clothing may be selected to have a low ash content and generate a minimum of 
harmful effluents, such as oxides of nitrogen or halogenated compounds. In other facilities, 
water‐washable, reusable protective clothing may minimize waste disposal.  
 
In many  nuclear  facilities,  contamination  of packaging  materials  is a problem.  For example,  if a 
tool or material (e.g., a pump or some ion exchange resin) is to be used in a contaminated area, as much of the packaging material must be removed as possible before the material enters the radiological area.  
 
Another  opportunity  for waste  minimization  occurs  when  materials  are used  as a contingency 
protection  against  contamination.  For example,  strippable  coatings  may  be applied  to an area  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
188  
 that is not expected to become contaminated or may receive only minor contamination so 
that it can be easily  cleaned.  Another  example involves  disposable  surgeons' gloves,  which  are 
routinely worn inside glove‐box gloves. Unless there are serious contamination control problems in the facility, these can be surveyed and disposed of as non‐radioactive  solid waste 
rather than LLW or TRU waste.  
 
If a piece of equipment is to have more than a single use in a contaminated environment, 
every  possible  measure  should  be taken  to ensure  its continued  reliability  rather  than  relying 
on frequent replacements. Tools should be of the highest quality and maximum flexibility 
consistent with the situation. For example, if a wrench is needed to maintain a piece of 
equipment in a glovebox, consideration should be given to future needs and storage 
provisions.  A socket  set with  interchangeable  sockets  may  ultimately  create less waste  than  a 
box‐end wrench of each size that is needed.  
 
Likewise, all tools and equipment to be placed in a contaminated environment should be 
tested  for reliability  and preferably  used  on a clean  mock‐up  to ensure  their  serviceability 
before they become contaminated in order to avoid unnecessary waste volume.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
189  
 9 EMERGENCY  MANAGEMENT  
It is DOE policy  that all DOE  facilities  and activities  be prepared  to deal  with  operational 
emergencies in a way that minimizes consequences to workers, the public, and the 
environment.  Formal  emergency  management  programs  are the final element of DOE’s 
defense‐in‐depth against adverse consequences resulting from its operations.  
 
9.1 Emergency  Management  in DOE  
 
DOE Order 151.1D ( 2019a ) requires each DOE location, including secure transportation 
activities,  administrative  offices  in the field,  and headquarters  offices  to plan  and prepare  for 
the management of emergencies. The following discussion of emergency management 
principles, requirements and guidance is generally applicable to DOE uranium facilities.  
Specific  facility  requirements  are in accordance  with  the individual  facility  DOE  contract.  The 
Emergency Management Guides (EMGs) provide guidance for implementing DOE Order  
151.1D  (2019a ). 
 
9.1.1 Basis  for DOE  Emergency  Management  Policy  
 
DOE emergency  management  policy  and direction  is based  on the following:  planning and 
preparedness commensurate with hazards; integrated planning for health, safety, and environmental emergencies; classification of and graded response to emergencies; and 
multiple levels (tiers) of emergency management responsibility.  
 
Note on Terminology: Within the Emergency Management  System (EMS), "planning"  includes 
the development of emergency plans and procedures and the identification of personnel and 
resources necessary to provide an effective response. "Preparedness" is the procurement and 
maintenance of resources, training of personnel, and exercising o f plans and procedures. 
"Response"  is the implementation  of the plans  during an emergency  to mitigate  consequences 
and to initiate recovery.  
 
9.1.1.1  Planning and Preparedness  Commensurate  with  Hazards  
 
Because of the wide range of activities and operations under DOE's authority, standards and 
criteria suited  to one type of facility or hazard  may  be inappropriate  for another.  To deal  with 
this diversity  in circumstances  while  ensuring an adequate  overall  state  of preparedness,  DOE 
Order 151.1D ( 2019a ) requires that the details of each feature be tailored to the unique 
hazards of the facility. This approach provides a more complete and quantitative 
understanding of the hazards while providing for focused and cost‐effective emergency 
planning and preparedness.  
 
9.1.1.2  Integrated  Planning for Health,  Safety,  and Environmental  Emergencies  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
190  
 A wide variety of different types of Operational Emergencies can occur at DOE operations. 
Some  may  involve  loss of control  over  radioactive  or other  hazardous  materials  unique  to DOE 
operations, while others may involve security, transportation activities, natural phenomena 
impacts, environmental damage, or worker safety and health concerns. Planning, 
preparedness , and response requirements applicable to DOE facilities and activities for some 
types of emergency conditions are specified by other agencies. For example, Federal 
regulations  on occupational  safety,  environmental protection  and hazardous  waste  operations 
have consequent “emergency planning” requirements. Rather than meet thes e requirements 
piecemeal through separate programs, each DOE/NNSA site/facility must have an Emergency 
Management Core Program that implements the requirements of applicable Federal, State, 
and local laws/regulations/ordinances for fundamental worker safet y programs (e.g., fire, 
safety, and security). These requirements are not unique to DOE/NNSA operations.  
 
9.1.1.3  Classification  of Emergencies  and Graded  Response  
 
Operational emergencies  involving  the airborne  release  of hazardous  materials  are grouped 
into one of three classes according to magnitude or severity. Classification of events is 
intended to promote more timely and effective response by triggering planned response actions appropriate to all events of a given classification. This principle, termed "graded 
response," is embodied in DOE Order 151.1D requirements and is important to the 
management of response resources (See DOE Order 151.1D Attach. 3, Sec. 8, Emergency 
Categorization) . 
 
9.1.1.4  Tiers  of Emergency  Management  Responsibility  
 
Within  the EMS,  responsibility  for emergency  management  extends  from  the individual  facility 
level to the cognizant DOE field element and culminates at the cognizant Headquarters 
Program Secretarial Office (PSO). The responsibilities vested at each level of the hierarchy are 
specified in DOE Order 151.1D ( 2019a ). The responsibility and authority for recognizing, 
classifying, and mitigating emergencies always rests with the facility staff. The cognizant Field 
Element Managers oversees the response of contractors and supports the response with 
communications, notifications, logistics, and coordination with other DOE elements. The DOE 
Headquarters (HQ) Emergency Operations Center (EOC) receives, coordinates, and 
disseminates emergency information to HQ elements, the cognizant PSO, Congressional 
offices, the White House, and other Federal Agencies (See DOE Order 151.1D Attach. A, 
Responsibilities ). 
 
9.1.2 Requirements  Pertaining  to All DOE  Operations  
 
DOE Order 151.1D ( 2019a ) identifies 14 core program elements that compose each DOE 
facility  emergency  management  program.  The 14 core  elements  form  a standard  framework, 
with the details of each program element varying according to the nature and magnitude of the facility hazards and other factors. The Order requires that a Hazard Survey be used to  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
191  
 identify the generic emergency events or conditions that define the scope of the emergency 
management program.  Where hazardous materials, such as uranium, are present in 
quantities exceeding the quantity that can be “easily and safely manipulated by one person” and whose potential release would cause the impacts and require response activities 
characteristic of an Operational Emergency, the Order requires a facility‐specific Emergency 
Planning Hazards  Assessment  (EPHA)  be conducted  and the results  used  as the technical  basis 
for the program  element content.  Using  the results  of an objective,  quantitative,  and rigorous 
hazards assessment as its basis, each program is configured to the specific hazards and 
response needs  of the facility.  
 
Detailed guidance on the implementation of the Order requirements has been published by 
the DOE Office of Emergency Management. These EMGs provide acceptable methods for 
meeting  the EMS  Order  requirements.  Individual  guides  have  been  published  for the technical 
planning basis (i.e., Hazards Survey/EPHA) processes and for programmatic and response 
program elements.  
 
9.2 Specific  Guidance  on Emergency  Management  for Uranium  Facilities  
This section  provides  technical  guidance  that is specifically  applicable  to the development  and 
implementation of emergency management programs for uranium facilities. It is intended to 
supplement, not replace, the more general recommendations provided in the EMGs.  
 
9.2.1 Technical  Planning  Basis  
 
9.2.1.1  Hazards  Survey  
 
The Emergency Management Core Program must be based on a Hazards Survey.  A Hazards 
Survey establishes the planning basis for the emergency management program. It is an 
examination  of the features  and characteristics  of the facility  or activity  to identify  the generic 
emergency events and conditions (including natural phenomena such as earthquakes and tornadoes; wild land fires; and other serious events involving or affecting health and safety, the environment, safeguards, and security at the facility) and the p otential impacts of such 
emergencies.  
In addition to the Emergency Management Core Program requirements (DOE O 151.1D Attachment 3), DOE sites, facilities, and activities must establish and maintain the Emergency 
Management Hazardous Materials Program (DOE O 151.1D Attachment 4) if any site, facility 
or activity  contains  hazardous  materials  that were  not screened  out by the hazardous  material 
screening process detailed in DOE O 151.1D ( 2019a ) Attachment 3.  
 
Each  Hazards  Survey  must : 
 
a. Describe  the applicable  potential health,  safety,  or environmental  impacts ; 
 
b. Identify  the need  for developing of further  planning and preparedness  beyond  the DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
192  
 Emergency  Management  Core  Program  requirements  that will apply  to each  type  of 
hazard ; 
 
c. Be submitted for approval to the Field Element Manager or appropriate Federal 
Manager;  and be updated  every  3 years  from  date  of issuance,  and when  there  are 
significant changes to site/facility/activity operations or to hazardous material 
inventories;  
 
d. Address  natural hazards,  technological  hazards,  and human‐caused  incidents ; 
 
e. Include  conducting a Site Threat  and Hazard  Identification  and Risk Assessment  (Site 
THIRA).  
 
A Hazardous Material Screening Process must identify specific hazardous materials and 
quantities that, if released, could produce impacts consistent with the definition of an 
Operational Emergency.  The potential  release  of these  materials  to the environment  requires 
further analysis in an EPHA. The release  of hazardous materials less than the quantities listed 
below does not require quantitative analysis in an EPHA.  
 
a. In general, to meet the definition of an Operational Emergency, the release of a 
hazardous  material must:  immediately  threaten  or endanger  personnel  and emergency 
responders who are in close proximity of the event; have the potential for dispersal beyond the safety of onsite personnel or the public in collocated facilities, activities, 
and/or  offsite;  and have  a potential  rate of dispersal sufficient  to require  a time‐urgent 
response to implement protective actions for workers and the public.  
 
b. The hazardous  material  screening process  must  identify  all hazardous  materials  in a 
facility/activity  that require  further  analysis  in an EPHA.  Specifically,  for r 
c. adioactive materials:  
 
1. All radioactive  materials  in a facility/activity  must  be subjected  to a hazardous 
material screening process.  
 
2. Radioactive materials that may be excluded from further analysis in an EPHA 
include: sealed radioactive sources that are engineered to pass the special form 
testing specified by the Department of Transportation (DOT) or the American 
National Standards Inst itute (ANSI); materials stored in DOT Type B shipping 
containers with overpack, if the Certificates of Compliance are current and the 
materials  stored  are authorized  by the Certificate;  and materials  used  in exempt, 
commercially available products.  
 
3. Radioactive  hazardous  materials  that require  further  analysis  in an EPHA  are those  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
193  
 associated  with  a defined  Hazard  Category  1, 2, or 3 nuclear facility  per 10 CFR Part 
830. Specifically those material contributing to the categorization of such a facility 
when in quantities greater than the largest Category 3 value (or if the sum of the 
ratios) exceeds any of the following:  
 
• DOE‐STD‐1027‐92,  Hazard Categorization and Accident  Analysis  Techniques 
for Compliance with DOE Order 5480.23, Nuclear Safety Analysis Reports 
(1997) ; 
 
• NA‐1  SD G 1027,  CN1,  Guidance  on Using Release  Fraction and Modern 
Dosimetric Information Consistently with DOE STD 1027‐92 (2011) ; 
 
• LA‐12981‐MS, Table of DOE‐STD‐1017‐92 Hazard Category 3 Threshold 
Quantities  for the ICRP‐30  List of 7574  Radionuclides,  LANL  Fact  Sheet  
(2002) ; 
 
• LA‐12846‐MS,  Specific  Activities  and DOE‐STD‐1027‐92 Hazard Category  2 
Thresholds , LANL Fact Sheet (1994) . 
 
4. The threshold screening quantities should not be used to eliminate from 
consideration  very  low‐specific  activity  substances,  such  as depleted,  natural,  or 
low‐enriched uranium in soluble forms.  For those materials, chemical‐ not 
radiological‐toxicity may be the dominant concern.  
 
5. In a few circumstances,  the chemical  toxicity  of a radioactive  substance  may  actually 
be of greater health concern than the potential radiation dose. Because the DOE Category 3 radionuclide thresholds are based on radiation dose alone, chemical 
toxicity may need to be considered when applying the screening values to very low 
specific activity radionuclides (or mixtures) that are known to also be chemically 
toxic. For  practical purposes, the concern  is limited to uranium of low  enrichment  in 
the form of compounds that are relatively soluble in body fluids (such as nitrates, 
fluorides, and sulfates). Depending on the exact proportions of the different 
uranium isotopes, the chemical toxicity concern becomes dominant as the nominal 
enrichment (
235U weight percent) decreases through the range from about 16 
percent to 5 percent. (Stannard, 1988).  
 
9.2.1.2  Emergency  Planning Hazards  Assessment  (EPHA)  
 
Unique  properties  and characteristics  of uranium  and its compounds  should  be considered  at 
certain steps in the EPHA process.  
 
a. Description  of Facility  and Operations.  The properties  of the hazardous  material  do not 
significantly affect the manner in which this step of the EPHA is performed, except to  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
194  
 the extent that uranium  safety  considerations  may  mandate  more  detailed  descriptions 
of certain facility physical or operational features.  
 
b. Characterizing the Hazards. The objective of this step is to describe the hazardous 
materials  in sufficient  detail  to allow  accurate  modeling  of releases  and calculation  of 
consequences. The following properties of uranium and its compounds strongly 
influence the release potential and consequences.  
 
• Chemical form. The chemical toxicity and reactive properties of any uranium 
compound must be weighed against the inherent toxicity of the compound or the uranium alone. For example, gaseous uranium hexafluoride (UF
6) reacts with 
atmospheric  moisture  and undergoes  hydrolysis,  producing uranyl  fluoride  (UO 2F2) 
and hydrogen fluoride (HF), a highly corrosive and toxic gas. Depending on the temperature, humidity, and uranium enrichment, the HF may be a more serious 
health and safety concern than either the UF
6 or the contained uranium. Some 
uranium compounds ignite violently on contact with air, water, or hydrocarbons.  
 
• Physical  form.  Physical  form  influences  the release  potential  and toxicity  of uranium 
and its compounds in numerous ways. Large, monolithic pieces of uranium metal may be relatively benign; however, they can develop a pyrophoric surface due to 
effects of air and moisture. Finely divided metallic uranium can react violently with 
nume rous other materials or self‐ignite in air, yielding respirable particles of 
uranium compounds. UF
6 is a solid at ambient temperature but goes directly to a 
gaseous state above ~270 °F at atmospheric pressure.  
 
• Solubility. For air exposure, permissible exposure levels for soluble uranium 
compounds  are based  on the chemical  toxicity  (particularly  to the kidney),  while  for 
insoluble compounds, radiotoxicity (radiation dose to the lung) is limiting.  
 
• Particle size. Particle size and the range of sizes have a large effect on the 
radiotoxicity of inhaled materials. Larger particles will be cleared rapidly from the 
upper respiratory  regions, delivering little radiation dose to the lung tissues. Small 
particles  are deposited  deeper  in the lung and are cleared  very  slowly,  producing a 
much larger dose per unit activity inhaled.  
 
• Enrichment. Enrichment, or specific activity of the isotope mixture, often 
determines  the relative  importance  of radiological and chemical  toxicity  for more 
soluble materials.  
 
c. Developing  Event  Scenarios.  Properties  of the hazardous  material  do not significantly 
affect the manner in which this step of the hazards assessment is performed.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
195  
 d. Estimating Potential Event Consequences. For the scenarios developed in the previous 
step,  this step  determines  the area  potentially  affected,  the need  for protective  actions, 
and the time available to take those actions. The way these consequences are determined will depend on properties of the hazardous material. For uranium and its 
compounds, the following possibilities should be considered.  
 
• Model types. Depending on the relative significance of radiological and chemical 
toxicity, the analyst may need to calculate either radiation dose, air concentration, 
or both  for the postulated  releases.  For a specific  scenario,  different  models  may  be 
needed  to analyze  different  consequences to  determine  which effect  is limiting (for 
example, radiation dose, soluble uranium intake, or HF concentration).  
 
• Model features. For reactive species, the ability to model the transformation and depletion  of material during transport  is important  to a sound  analysis.  Because  the 
hydrated  uranyl  fluoride  formed  by hydrolysis  of UF
6 is a solid,  some  will be lost due 
to gravitational settling as a plume moves away from the release point. When analyzing consequences of a postulated accidental criticality, correcting for the 
decay during transport of the short‐lived fission product gases will produce a more 
accurate assessment of consequences.  
 
9.2.2 Program  Elements  
 
Properties and characteristics of uranium and its compounds will also need to be considered  
in formulating  the emergency  management  program  elements.  Following  are specific  program 
element considerations related to the hazardous properties of uranium.  
 
9.2.2.1  Programmatic  Elements  
 
The specific properties of the hazardous material do not significantly affect the content of the 
programmatic  elements:  Program  Administration,  Training  and Drills,  Exercises,  and Readiness 
Assurance.  
 
9.2.2.2  Response  Elements  
 
a. Emergency Response Organization. The primary influence of uranium’s hazardous 
properties on the Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is in the staffing of the consequence assessment component. As will be discussed below in Consequence Assessment, staff assigned to the ERO should be knowl edgeable of, and able to 
quantitatively  evaluate,  both  the health  physics  (radiological)  and industrial hygiene 
(non‐radiological) aspects of the hazard.  
 
a. Offsite  Response  Interfaces.  The specific  properties  of the hazardous  material do not 
significantly affect the content of this program element.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
196  
 b. Operational Emergency  Event  Classes. As with  all hazardous  materials,  classification  of 
emergencies for uranium facilities should be based on the predicted consequences at 
specific receptor locations, as compared with numerical criteria for taking protective 
action (dose, exposure, air concentration). If a material has two or more recogniz ed 
modes  of effect  and associated  protective action  criteria,  classification  decisions  should 
be based on the more limiting one.  
 
c. Example:  The postulated  release  of a quantity  of a uranium  compound  will produce  a 
radiological consequence corresponding to the classification criterion for Alert. The 
chemical toxicity of the uranium compound is such that the non‐radiological 
consequence exceeds the criterion for Site Area Emergency. The postulated release 
should be classified as a Site Area Emergency.  
 
The appropriate classification for the postulated event or condition should be 
determined  during the EPHA  process  and the observable  features  and indications 
identified as Emergency Action Levels (EALs) for that event/condition.  
 
d. Notification.  The specific  properties  of the hazardous  material do not significantly  affect 
the content of this program element.  
 
e. Consequence Assessment. As discussed in section 9.2.1.2(d), models and calculation 
methods used for consequence assessment should be appropriate physical, chemical, 
and radiological properties of the hazards. Models used to calculate and project the 
radiological and non‐radiological consequences of a release of uranium and it s 
compounds  should  be the same  ones used  in the EPHA  process.  If the  same models  are 
not used,  the differences  between  outputs  should  be characterized  and documented  to 
avoid the potential for confusion and indecision during response to an actual emergency . 
 
Environmental monitoring  capability  for assessing  consequences  of a uranium  release 
should conform to several general principles.  
 
• Procedures  for measurement  of airborne  uranium  should  provide  for timely  analysis 
and reporting of results in units that correspond to decision criteria. Decision points 
based on initial screening measurements with field instruments should account for 
the expected levels of radon progeny collected on the air sample media. Portable 
survey  instruments  capable  of performing  alpha  spectroscopy  measurements  can be 
used to provide rapid isotopic analysis of uranium collected on sample media.  
 
• Measurement of uranium  deposition  should  be planned  and proceduralized  to yield 
results that correspond to those produced by the predictive models used for 
emergency response. The correlation between direct or indirect radioactivity measurements (in units of activity) and measurement methods that give mass or  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
197  
 concentration  of uranium  in a sample  should  be established  for the expected 
enrichment values of material that might be released.  
 
• If the potential exists for release of uranium compounds with high chemical toxicity 
(such as UF 6), it is not practical to plan to use survey teams to quantify 
concentrations in a plume. The high risk to survey personnel, the protective 
equipment  necessary  to minimize  that risk, the time  needed  to prepare  and position 
a team for such a survey, and the limited value of the information that could be 
gained  all weigh against  this approach  to assessing  the consequence  of a highly  toxic 
release.  
 
• Environmental air concentrations  are commonly  measured  continuously  around  the 
perimeter of some uranium facilities. Consequence assessment procedures should 
provide for the rapid retrieval and analysis of sample media from fixed samplers 
that may be operating in an area affected by a uranium release.  
 
f. Protective  Actions.  Because  the health  consequences  of a given  intake  of uranium,  or its 
compounds, are highly dependent on properties such as enrichment, particle size, and 
solubility,  facility  and site‐specific  protective  action  criteria stated  in terms  of observable 
quantities and features of the release should be developed. In order for protective 
action criteria stated in terms of calculated dose or concentration to be valid, the 
calculational models should account for the properties of the material.  
 
The Protective Action Guides (PAGs) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency  (EPA,  2016)  have  been  adopted  by DOE  as its basic  protective action  criteria for 
planning and response.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

a. This guidance  does  not address  or impact  site cleanups  occurring  under  other  statutory  authorities  such  as the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Superfund program, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) 
decommissioning program, or other federal or state cleanup programs.  
b. Should begin  at 1 rem (10 mSv);  take  whichever  action  (or combination  of actions)  that results in the lowest  exposure for 
the majority of the population. Sheltering may begin at lower levels if advantageous.  
c.  Projected  dose is the sum  of the effective  dose from  external  radiation  exposure (e.g.,  groundshine  and plume submersion) 
and the committed effective dose from inhaled radioactive material. 
d. Provides  thyroid  protection  from  radioactive  iodines  only.  See the complete 2001 FDA guidance,  “Potassium  Iodide as a 
Thyroid  Blocking  Agent  in Radiation  Emergencies.”  Further information  is also available  in “KI in Radiation  Emergencies, 
2001 – Questions and Answers” 2002, and “Frequently Asked Questions on Potassium Iodide (KI).” 
e. Thyroid  dose.  See Section  1.4.2.  For information  on radiological  prophylactics  and treatment  other  than KI, refer  to

f.  When radiation control options are not available, or, due to the magnitude of the incident, are not sufficient, doses to 
emergency workers above 5  rem (50 mSv) may be unavoidable and are generally approved by competent authority. For 
further  discussion  see Chapter  3, Section  3.1.2.  Each  emergency  worker  should be fully  informed of the risks of exposure 
they  may  experience and trained,  to the extent  feasible,  on actions  to be taken.  Each  emergency  worker  should make  an 
informed decision as to how much radiation risk they are willing to accept to save lives.

i. This cleanup process does not rely on and does not affect any authority, including the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response,  Compensation  and Liability  Act (CERCLA),  42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq. and the National  Contingency  Plan  (NCP),  40 CFR 
Part 300. This document expresses no view as to the availability of legal authority to implement this process in any  
particular  situation.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
199  
  
Facilities having substantive and persuasive arguments for using other protective action 
threshold values may propose values that are specific to their radioactive material holdings 
and operations.  Any alternative  proposals  should  be supported  by an analysis  that addresses 
the four principles that form the basis for the selection of the EPA PAG values and the other 
considerations utilized in the selection process . 
 
g. Medical Support. If the potential exists for significant uranium intakes, the emergency 
management program should include specific planning for the quantification of exposure, diagnosis of health effects, and treatment. Medical facilities providing 
emergency medical suppor t should be provided with references relating to uranium 
toxicity and treatment protocols. Criteria for implementing  treatments such as surgical 
excision  of contaminated  tissue  or use of chelating agents  should  be discussed  with  the 
medica l staff and sources of real‐time advice and assistance should be identified.  
 
h. Recovery  and Reentry.  The specific  properties  of the hazardous  material do not 
significantly affect the content of this program element.  
 
i. Public  Information.  The specific  properties  of the hazardous  material do not 
significantly affect the content of this program element.  
 
j. Emergency  Facilities  and Equipment.  Except for instruments  and analysis  methods  used 
in consequence assessment, specialized facilities and equipment will not be required to 
meet the emergency management program needs of uranium facilities. Equipment and 
analytical techniques for detection and measurement of uranium in environmental 
sample media should have sufficient sensitivity to measure levels at or below those 
corresponding to decision  criteria.  Whereas  larger sample  sizes  or longer counting  times 
may be used to reduce the limit of detection for routine environmental surveillance, 
time constraints may dictate that more sensitive techniques be used for emergency 
response. Kinetic phosphorimetry, a fast, sensitive, and accurate method for direct  
determination of uranium, permits analysis of many sample media directly or with 
limited sample preparation.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
200  
 10 DECOMISSIONING  
At the end of the useful life, nuclear facilities are deactivated by placing the facility in a safe 
and stable condition by removing the fuel, draining and/or de‐energizing nonessential 
systems, and removal of stored radioactive and hazardous materials and  related actions. To 
minimize  or eliminate  long‐term  institutional  control  of a facility,  with  adequate  regard  for the 
health and safety of workers and the public and to protect the environment, a decision may  
be made to undergo a decommissioning program. Decommissioning generally takes place 
after deactivation, and includes surveillance and maintenance, decontamination, and/or 
dismantlement.  The ultimate  goal  of decommissioning  is unrestricted  release  or restricted  use 
of the site.  
 
This section provides guidance on establishing and implementing an effective decommissioning program. Major topic areas include regulations and standards, design features,  decommissioning program,  decommissioning  techniques,  and decommissioning 
experience.  The following subsections  concentrate on the radiation  protection aspects  of 
decommissioning at uranium‐contaminated DOE facilities.  
 
10.1 REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK  
 
Decontamination and decommissioning of a DOE uranium facility require adherence to a 
complex array of regulations and policies. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 
1976  (RCRA)  and the Comprehensive  Environmental Response,  Compensation,  and Liability 
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) are the two main regulatory programs that directly impact the 
decommissioning of DOE facilities.  
 
10.1.1  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery  Act of 1976  (RCRA) 
 
The purpose of RCRA is to reduce the total quantity of hazardous waste generated and to 
prevent  releases  of hazardous  waste  to the  environment  by controlling waste  from  the cradle‐ 
to‐grave. Section 6001 of RCRA details that the provisions of RCRA apply to Federal facilities. 
Section 6001 also subjects Federal facilities to civil penalties and confirms Federal employees 
are personally liable for criminal violations of the provisions of RCRA. I f the facility is being 
decommissioned  under  a RCRA  permit  or order, the EPA or the State  may  have  RCRA  authority 
over actions taken at the facility during decommissioning.  This may include authority to 
review documents, set timetables, or require specific closure or corrective actions. Even if a 
facility does not have a RCRA permit, RCRA requirements may be applicable and relevant or 
appropriate requirements under CERCLA.  
 
10.1.2  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,  Compensation,  and Liability  Act (CERCLA)  
 
CERCLA,  as amended  by the Superfund  Amendments  and Reauthorization  Act of 1986,  was 
enacted to identify and remediate sites where hazardous substances were, or could be,  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
201  
 released  into the environment.  Executive  Order  12580,  Superfund Implementation, delegated 
authority to the Secretary of Energy for evaluating whether conditions at sites under the 
jurisdiction, custody, or control of DOE meet the CERCLA definition of significant threat of 
release of hazardous substances. If so, DOE is authorized to co nduct response activities 
consistent  with  40 CFR Part 300,  National  Oil and Hazardous  Substances  Pollution  Contingency 
Plan.  For sites listed on the National Priorities List, t he EPA has responsibility for ensuring  that 
actions taken by DOE comply with CERCLA requirements and may take legal action against 
DOE in the event that EPA does not agree with DOE’s determination.  
 
10.1.3  National  Environmental  Policy  Act 
 
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) establishes a national policy to ensure that 
environmental factors are considered in planning and decision‐making by federal agencies. 
The decommissioning of a DOE uranium facility will require a determination w hether the 
proposed  action  is a major federal action  that may  have  significant  environmental  impacts  and 
requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS).  An environmental 
assessment (EA) may be prepared to assist in making this determin ation.  The EA or EIS must 
discuss the amount of material that will remain onsite and its effect, in addition to addressing 
the alternatives.  The alternatives will include retaining radioactive material onsite under DOE 
control, cleaning the site to a level that would be acceptable for unrestricted release, and the 
null or no‐action  alternative  of “walking away” from  the site.  If the action does not  require  an 
EA or EIS, either because the possible adverse effects are insignificant or because 
decommissioning was adequately addressed in a pre‐operational or other EA or EIS, then the 
decommissioning can proceed in accordance with the information contained in ot her 
applicable regulations.  
 
10.1.4  DOE  Directives  and Standards  
 
No single DOE  Directive  covers  all decommissioning requirements  due to the  wide  variety  of 
issues encompassed by decommissioning. These issues include project management, 
environmental surveillance,  health  and safety  of workers  and the public,  engineering design, 
characterization survey techniques, decommissioning techniques, waste management, and 
waste transport.  
 
10.1.4.1  DOE Order  435.1 Chg 2 , Radioactive  Waste  Management  (2021a)  
 
The management and disposal of  radioactive  waste resulting  from  environmental  restoration 
activities, including decommissioning, must meet the substantive requirements for DOE O 
435.1 Chg 2 , Radioactive  Waste  Management  (2021a), as well as DOE  M 435.1‐1  Chg 3 , 
Radioactive  Waste Management Manual (2021b). DOE radioactive waste must be 
appropriately managed so as to protect the public from exposure to radiation from radioactive materials; protect the environment; and protect workers, including following the 
requirements of 10 CFR Part 835.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
202  
 10.1.4.2  DOE Order  430.1C  Chg 2 , Real  Property  Asset Management  (2020b)  
 
DOE Order 430.C, Real Property Asset Management (2016b), and associated guides establish 
an integrated corporate, holistic, and performance based approach to the life‐cycle 
management of real property assets. It directs that acquisition, sustainment, recapitalization, 
and disposal is balanced to ensure real property assets are available, utilized, and in suitable 
cond ition  to accomplish  DOE  missions.  DOE  O 430.1C  further  directs  that industry  standards,  a 
balanced approach, and performance objectives are to be used in managing an asset throughout its life‐cycle, including disposition.  Disposition are activities that in clude 
preparation for reuse, surveillance, maintenance, deactivation, decommissioning, and long‐ 
term stewardship. DOE G 430.1‐4, Decommissioning Implementation Guide (1999) was 
developed  to aid in the planning and implementation  of decommissioning activities  in support 
of DOE O430.1C.  
 
10.1.4.3  DOE Order  458.1 Chg 4 , Radiation Protection  of the Public  and the Environment  (2020a ) 
 
DOE Order 458.1 Ch g 4 (2020a ), provides radiological protection requirements and guidelines 
for release  and clearance  of property  and management,  storage,  and disposal  of the wastes  at 
DOE sites.  This DOE Order establishes a basic public dose limit for exposure to residual 
radioactive  material (in addition  to naturally  occurring  background  radiation  exposures)  not to 
exceed  a total  effective  dose  (TED)  of 100‐mrem  (1‐mSv)  in a year.  A more  detailed  discussion 
on authorized limits is presented in section 10.2.3.  
 
10.2 Residual  Radioactivity  Levels  
 
A primary concern in the decommissioning of any nuclear facility is the level of residual 
radioactivity that may be permitted for unrestricted use. Before a property that has the 
potential  to contain  residual radioactive  material can be released  from  control,  it must  meet 
dose limits under any plausible use of the property and ALARA process requirements.  
 
10.2.1  Public  Dose  Limits  
 
DOE  Order  458.1 requires  radiological activities  to be conducted  so that exposure  to members 
of the public to ionizing radiation will not cause a TED of greater than 100 mrem in a year, an equivalent dose to the lens of the eye not greater than 1500 mrem in a year, or an equivalent 
dose to the skin or extremities exceeding 5000 mrem in a y ear. 
 
10.2.2  ALARA  process  requirements  
 
In addition to public dose limits, a documented ALARA process must be implemented for decommissioning activities  in a manner  that ensures  that dose  to members  of the public  and 
releases to the environment are kept as low as reasonably achievable.  This process must 
consider  DOE  sources, modes  of exposure,  and all pathways  which  could  result  in the release  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
203  
 of radioactive materials into the environment or exposure to the public.  Though the ALARA 
process is not applicable to non‐routine events (i.e., accidental or inadvertent releases or 
exposures), it is applicable during recovery and remediation associated with non‐routine 
events.  DOE‐HDBK‐1215‐2014 Chg Notice 1 (Reaffirmed 2022) ( 2014a ), Optimizing Radiation 
Protection  of the Public and the Environment  For Use With  DOE  O 458.1,  ALARA  Requirements , 
provides  detailed  information to assist in understanding what is necessary and acceptable for 
implementing the ALARA provision of the Order.  
 
10.2.3  Dose  Constraints  
 
To ensure that public dose limits from exposure to residual radioactive material from all DOE 
sources are met, DOE O 458.1 applies dose constraints to each specific clearance of property 
for any actual  or likely  future  use of the property.  For real property,  the dose  constraint  is set 
at a total effective dose of 25 mrem above background in any calendar year.  For personal 
property, the dose constraint is set at 1 mrem above background in any calendar year.  
 
10.2.4  Authorized Limits  
 
Authorized  limits  must  be established  and approved  for clearance  of any property  containing 
or potentially containing residual radioactive material.  Authorized limits must  
 
• Be developed  in accordance  with  DOE  O 458.1 Chg 4 (2020a ), ALARA  requirements;  
 
• Be based  on the applicable  dose  constraint,  supported  by a complete  exposure  pathway 
analysis using appropriate methodologies, techniques, parameters, and models that 
meet DOE quality assurance requirements under DOE O 414.1D  Chg 2 , Quality 
Assurance (2020d ); 
 
• Be expressed in terms of concentration of radioactivity per unit surface area (e.g., dpm 
per 100 cm2), radioactivity  per unit mass  (e.g.,  pCi per gram)  or volume  (e.g.,  pCi per ml), 
total radioactivity, or DOE controls and restrictions, if applicable;  
 
• Explicitly  state  any restrictions  or conditions  on future  use of the property  necessary  to 
ensure the basic dose limit and applicable dose constraint are not exceeded;  
 
• Include  written  notification  of applicable  Federal,  State,  or local regulatory  agencies  or 
Tribal governments; and  
 
• Be approved  in accordance  with  DOE O 458.1 Chg 4 ( 2020a ), DOE  Approval  of 
Authorized Limits.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

10.2.4.1  Pre‐approved  authorized  Limits  
 
In accordance with DOE O 458.1 Chg (2020a ), pre‐approved authorized limits may be used 
instead of  developing specific  authorized  limits  once  the specific  application  of the Authorized  
Limits  is approved by the responsible Field Element Manager.  For uranium facilities, the 
preapproved Surface Contamination Guidelines are listed in Table 10‐1.

10.2.5  Survey  and Monitoring  
 
Survey  and monitoring  to support  decommissioning activities  must : 
 
• Use methodologies  such  as MARSSIM,  MARSAME,  or other  DOE‐approved 
methodologies ; 
 
• Meet  measurement  or data  quality  objectives ; 
 
• Use DOE‐approved  sampling and analysis  techniques ; 
 
• Include  an evaluation  of non‐uniformly  distributed  residual  radioactive  material,  if 
applicable.  
 
Survey  and monitoring  instrumentation  must  be capable  of detecting  and quantifying residual 
radioactive  material,  consistent  with  applicable  authorized  limits. In addition  to MARSSIM  and 
MARSAME, DOE‐HDBK‐1216‐2015 Chg Notice 1 (2015), Environmental Radiological Effluent 
Monitoring and Environmental Surveillance, identifies procedures, systems, methods, 
instruments, and practices that may  be used to  plan and implement radiological monitoring 
and environmental surveillance.  
 
10.3 Design  Features  for New  Facilities  
 
Design of the facility  should  allow  easy  decommissioning  of equipment  and materials. Details 
on designing facilities for ease of decommissioning are discussed in the following sections.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
205  
 10.3.1  Building  Materials  
 
In general, the design features that aid in contamination control during operation also 
facilitate  decommissioning.  The inclusion  of all the building materials  suggested  in this section 
may be cost‐prohibitive, but they should be considered if the budget allows. Maintenance 
procedures that are used during operation are also important in controlling the spread of 
contamination to clean areas and, therefore, facilitate decommissioning, too.  
 
Less permeable building materials are more easily decontaminated. Any concrete with 
uncoated surfaces that comes in contact  with uranium solutions or uranium‐contaminated air 
will require  surface  removal  and disposal  as radioactive  waste  at the end of its life. If there are 
cracks through  which contaminated solutions have penetrated, the  entire structure may  need 
to be disposed of as radioactive waste.  
 
Metal surfaces may also require decontamination. In general, the more highly polished the 
surface,  the easier  it will be to decontaminate.  If feasible,  all stainless  steel  that will come  into 
contact with uranium should be electro‐polished before being placed into service. If high‐ 
efficiency  particulate  air (HEPA) filtration  has failed  at any time  during facility  operation,  roofs 
may require decontamination. Metal roofs are easiest to decontaminate, but even these may 
contribute to the volume of radioactive waste unless unusual measures are taken to clean 
them. Built‐up and composition roofs will be difficult to clean to unre stricted release levels.  
Interior surfaces  are most  easily  cleaned  if they  were  completely  primed  and painted  before 
the introduction of radioactive materials into the facility. If interior surfaces are repainted 
during operation, their disposal as clean waste is likely to require removal of the paint.  
However,  if the paint  has deteriorated,  cleaning  for unrestricted  use may  be as difficult  as if 
the material had  never been  painted. Wood  will almost  certainly  become contaminated, as 
will plasterboard and other such materials.  
 
Floor surfaces are likely to be a problem. Concrete should be well sealed and covered with a 
protective surface.  Single  sheet,  vinyl  flooring  with  heat‐sealed  seams  is preferable  to asphalt 
or vinyl  tile because  it is more  easily  cleaned. If  the floor  needs resurfacing,  it is preferable to 
overlay  new  flooring  material rather than  remove  the old material and expose  the underlying 
floor.  
 
Carpets are not recommended because they are difficult to clean and survey and bulky to 
dispose  of and they  do not adequately  protect  the underlying surface.  In some  areas,  such  as 
control rooms, their use may be justified by noise control requirements; however, their 
contamination control limitations should be considered. If used, carpets should be surveyed 
frequently and disposed of as radioactive waste when they become contaminated.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
206  
 10.4 Ventilation Systems  
 
In addition to decommissioning considerations, the design of the ventilation system will 
depend on the operations conducted in the facility. Adequate air flow for all operations and 
good design practices will help keep the facility clean during operations and will facilitate 
decommissioning.  Fiberglass  duct  work  may  present  a fire hazard  and may  be more  difficult  to 
decontaminate than stainless steel, especially stainless steel that has been electro‐polished.  
Welded  joints  are less likely  to collect  contamination  than  bolted  ones;  however,  bolted  joints 
are easier to remove and the most contaminated areas are readily accessible for cleaning.  
 
Filters  should  be positioned  in ventilation  systems  to minimize  contamination  of ductwork 
(e.g., filtration of glove‐box exhaust air before it enters a duct leading to a plenum).  
 
10.4.1  Piping  Systems  
 
Potentially contaminated piping systems imbedded in concrete are a common and relatively expensive decommissioning problem.  Most  often,  they  must  be sealed  and removed  last, after 
all other radioactive material has been removed and the building is being demolished by conventional methods. Often, they provide the major impetus for demolishing a building 
rather than converting it to some non‐nuclear use. For this reason, it is b est to run pipes in 
chases or tunnels that have been lined (usually with stainless  steel) to prevent contamination 
from penetrating building surfaces. To minimize hand jackhammer work required during decommissioning, floor drains should not be enclosed in concrete.  
 
10.4.2  Soil‐Contamination Considerations  
 
Depending on the activity levels found, locations where contaminated effluents have 
penetrated the ground may require excavation during decommissioning. The facility design 
should minimize such areas. Particular attention should be paid to storm runoff from roofs, 
storage  areas,  contaminated  equipment  storage,  and liquid  waste  treatment  impoundments 
(including sanitary  sewage  systems  if they  may  receive  some  small amount  of contamination 
during the life of the facility).  
 
10.4.3  Other  Features  
 
Installed decontamination and materials‐handling equipment that facilitates operation and 
maintenance also generally facilitates decommissioning in two ways. First, it can be used for its intended  purposes  of cleaning and moving  equipment  during the decommissioning phase. 
Even more important, it usually contributes to a cleaner, better‐maintained facility, where 
nonfunctional equipment is moved out when it is no longer needed and work surfaces are 
kept free of spreadable contamination.  
 
Other  features  include  the following:  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
207  
  
• minimizing  service  piping,  conduits,  and ductwork,  
 
• caulking  or sealing  all cracks,  crevices,  and joints,  
 
• using modular,  separable  confinements  for radioactive  or other  hazardous  materials 
to preclude contamination of fixed portions of the structure,  
 
• using localized  liquid  transfer systems that avoid  long runs  of buried  contaminated 
piping,  
 
• using equipment  that precludes  the accumulation  of radioactive  or other  hazardous 
materials in relatively inaccessible areas, including curves and turns in piping and 
ductwork,  
 
• using designs  that ease  cut‐up,  dismantling,  removal,  and packaging  of contaminated 
equipment from the facility,  
 
• using modular  radiation  shielding,  in lieu of or in addition  to monolithic  shielding 
walls,  
 
• using lifting  lugs on large  tanks  and equipment,  and 
 
• using fully  drainable  piping systems  that carry  contaminated  or potentially 
contaminated liquids.  
 
10.5 DECOMMISSIONING  PROGRAM  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Planning for facility decommissioning should be initiated during the design phase for new facilities and before termination of operations for existing operational facilities. To assist in 
decommissioning activity  planning the Office  of Environmental  Management  distributed  the 
“Decommissioning Resource Manual.” Refer to that document for guidance.  
 
DOE  Order  430.1C  Chg 2 , Real  Property  Asset Management  (DOE,  2020b ), contains  the 
requirements by which all applicable DOE projects must be managed.  This technical standard 
sets for the requirements for real property asset life‐cycle management including: planning 
and budgeting, acquisition, sustainment, disposition, performance measurement, and 
reporting systems.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
208  
 10.5.1  Pre‐Operational  and Operational  Activities  
 
Determination  of the natural  background  levels  of radiation  and of the background  and fallout 
radionuclides is a critical step in decommissioning. These levels are best determined before 
the facility becomes operational. These  levels need  to be determined so  the incremental  dose 
occurring from material left onsite at the termination of operations can be assessed.  
 
The contamination  control  practices  and records  maintained  during facility operation  will also 
be important.  If paint  is used  in contamination  fixation  (seldom  an optimum,  but sometimes a 
necessary, practice),  it should  be of a distinctive  color  and the location  should  be permanently 
recorded. Other records are also helpful in planning and executing final decontamination for 
dismantling. Spills, pipe and tank leaks, ventilation failures, burial of low‐level radioactive or 
potentially radioactive materials onsite, or other actions that might affect decommissioning 
shall become part of the permanent record of the facility and be considered in 
decommissioning planning. Insights from workers who worked at the facility during the 
operational phase can also provide useful information on past incidents.  
 
10.5.2  Post‐Operational  Activities  
 
DOE program organizations shall identify contaminated facilities under their jurisdiction, 
document the potential for reuse and recovery of materials and equipment, and develop 
decommissioning schedules. Before decommissioning activities begin, adequate su rveillance 
and maintenance should be performed for inactive facilities that allow them to: 1) meet 
applicable radiation protection, hazardous chemical, and safety standards, 2) maintain  
physical safety and security standards, and 3) reduce potential public  and environmental 
hazards. Deactivation operations, such as removing all high‐level waste and stored hazardous 
materials,  should  be performed  by the facility  operator  as part of the last operational  activities 
before entering into the decommissioning phase.  
 
10.5.3  Decommissioning  Activities  
 
The following  discussion  of decommissioning activities  is divided  into four  phases:  site 
characterization, environmental review process, general decommissioning planning, 
decommissioning project plan, and decommissioning operations.  
 
10.5.3.1  Site Characterization  
 
Characterization data shall be collected to support a thorough physical, chemical, and 
radiological characterization to fulfill the requirements of NEPA reviews, and the 
RCRA/CERCLA  preliminary  assessment/site  investigations  and detailed  engineering studies. 
The facility characterization shall include the following:  
 
• drawings,  photographs,  or other  records  reflecting  the as‐built  and as‐modified  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
209  
 condition  of the facility  and grounds,  
 
• the condition  of all structures,  existing  protective barriers,  and systems installed  to 
ensure public, occupational, and environmental safety,  
 
• the type,  form,  quantity,  and location  of hazardous  chemical and radioactive  material 
from past operations at the site, and  
 
• information on factors that could influence the selection of decommissioning 
alternatives  (safe  storage,  entombment,  dismantling),  such  as potential  future  use, long‐ 
range site plans, facility condition, and potential health, safety, and environmental hazards.  
 
One portion of the site‐characterization process is a composite of several different types of 
surveys: background, scoping (or preliminary site characterization), and detailed 
characterization, as defined by Berger (1992). Guidance for conducting site characterizations 
as part of the remedial investigations/feasibility  studies  (RI/FS)  under  CERCLA  can be found  in 
EPA/540/G‐89/004, Guidance for Conducting Remedial Investigations and Feasibility Studies 
Under CERCLA (1988).  
 
The background survey information (i.e., direct rad iation levels and concentrations of 
potential  radionuclide  contaminants  in construction  materials  and soils)  may  be performed  as 
part of the environmental baseline studies during pre‐operational activities. Otherwise, background levels should be determined at onsite or immediately offsite locations that are unaffected by operations.  
 
The scoping or preliminary site characterization study should be performed to identify the 
potential radionuclide contaminants at the site, the relative ratios of these nuclides, and the 
general extent of contamination. The survey provides the basis for in itial estimates of the 
required decommissioning effort and a framework for planning the more detailed 
characterization study. A limited number of measurements will be made at locations that are 
most  likely  to have  contamination.  Scoping or preliminary  site characterization  surveys  may  be 
conducted during the post‐operational phase.  
 
The detailed  characterization  survey  will more  precisely  define  the extent  and magnitude  of 
contamination.  The resulting data  will be used  to assist  in planning for the decontamination 
effort, including decontamination techniques and health and safety considerations during decommissioning.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
210  
 10.5.3.2  Environmental  Review  Process  
 
Candidate decommissioning alternatives should be identified, assessed, and evaluated, and 
preferred decommissioning alternatives should be selected based on the results of the 
environmental review. The review should be performed according to the requiremen ts of 
NEPA,  RCRA,  and CERCLA.  Depending on the operation,  the environmental  review  may  consist 
of an EA or an EIS (see Section 10.2.1).  
 
10.5.3.3  Decommissioning  Planning  
 
The first step in decommissioning planning is the development  of a series of absolute criteria. 
These will necessarily  include  such items  as compliance  with  DOE regulations  and Orders,  EPA 
regulations,  interagency  agreements,  and other  statutes.  They  may  also include  commitments 
to states, landowners, or others, or provisions of a Record of Decision.  
 
As these criteria are developed, other high‐value criteria may also be established. These are likely to include such considerations as maximizing the aesthetic and recreational value of the 
site, performing decommissioning within allocated funds, lowest wo rker dose, lowest 
population dose, lowest cost, lowest future surveillance commitment, and least effect in case 
of probable  accidents.  Depending on the viability  of the decommissioning action,  the decision‐ 
making process that has been established, and the  level of public concern, notice of a scoping 
meeting may be published in the Federal Register and scoping meetings may be held. Similar 
actions may be taken to determine the applicable decommissioning criteria and the 
alternatives to be considered.  
 
Whether or not a formal scoping meeting and EIS are used, it will be necessary to define the 
decommissioning options  to be considered.  Most  of the analysis  effort  should  be expended  on 
those options that fulfill the absolute criteria so they can be ranked relative to the other high‐ value criteria. General options would typically include the following, which are taken from 
NUREG‐0586, Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) on Decommissioning of 
Nuclear Facilities (NRC, 2002):  
 
a. Decontamination (DECON)  ‐ Decontamination  is the alternative  in which  contaminated 
equipment,  structures,  and portions  of a facility  are physically  removed  from  the site or 
their radioactive contaminants are removed by chemical or abrasive means. This 
alternative is the preferred approach to decommissioning uranium‐contaminated 
facilities.  
 
b. Safe Storage (SAFSTOR) ‐ SAFSTOR is sometimes referred to as "deferred 
decommissioning,"  the alternative  in which  nuclear  facilities  are placed  and maintained 
in such a condition that the structure and contents can be safely stored and eventually 
decommissioned. In preparing a facility for SAFSTOR, the structure is left intact, but all 
nuclear fuels, radioactive  fluids,  and wastes  are removed  from  the site.  This alternative  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
211  
 is generally  considered  when  the following  conditions  occur:  
 
1. Low‐level  waste  disposal capacity  is inadequate  to implement  DECON.  
 
2. An adjacent  operating  nuclear  facility  would  be adversely  affected  if the DECON 
alternative were implemented.  
 
3. A positive benefit would  be derived  through  a limited  period  of radioactive decay.  A 
cost‐benefit analysis should be performed, comparing total cost and radiation 
exposure resulting from DECON versus SAFSTOR. Then, a decision should be made whether any additional costs incurred for the SAFSTOR alternative are justified by 
the dose  savings.  Due to the long half‐lives  of uranium  isotopes,  radioactive  decay  is 
not a viable reason for using the SAFSTOR Deactivation and Decontamination 
option.  
 
c. Entombment (ENTOMB) ‐ The entombment alternative involves removing all nuclear 
fuels, radioactive fluids, and wastes from the site and encasing all structural and 
mechanical materials and components not decontaminated to acceptable levels in a 
structurally  long‐lived  material,  such  as concrete.  The entombed  structure  is maintained 
under appropriate continued surveillance until the radioactivity decays to a level 
permitting unrestricted release of the facility. The maximum allowable time in 
entombment should  be less than 100 years. Due to the long half‐lives of uranium 
isotopes, entombment is not a viable option for decommissioning of uranium‐ 
contaminated facilities.  
 
d. The no‐action  alternative,  as required by NEPA  ‐ In decommissioning,  this is normally 
considered the "walk away" option.  
 
Conversion of a facility for alternate nuclear or other controlled use has sometimes been considered a decommissioning mode; however, it is not truly decommissioned unless 
conversion  involves  removal of all radioactive  material.  Final disposition,  when  it occurs  at the 
end of the new use, should consider the residual radioactivity onsite.  
 
10.5.3.4  Decommissioning Project  Plan 
 
A decommissioning project  plan  should  be prepared  and should  include  the following:  
 
a. physical,  chemical,  and radiological characterization  data  or references  to such  data ; 
 
b. a summary  evaluation  of decommissioning alternatives  for the facility,  including the 
preferred alternatives ; 
 
c. plans  for meeting  requirements  from  the environmental review  process  (NEPA,  RCRA ; DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
212  
 and CERCLA),  
 
d. radiological  criteria to be used ; 
 
e. development  of a health  and safety  plan  for decommissioning ; 
 
f. project ions of occupational  exposure ; 
 
g. estimated  quantities  of radioactive  waste  to be generated ; and 
 
h. detailed  administrative,  cost‐schedule,  and management  information.  
 
If a contractor will be used  to perform  the decommissioning operations,  the plan  should 
include detailed technical specifications for selecting a contractor.  
 
The site characterization survey should provide the necessary information on the type of 
facility  or land  area to be decommissioned  and the type  and amount  of residual radioactive 
material that must be cleaned up. Other information to be considered in deciding the appropriate decommissioning alternative includes the following:  
 
a. the availability  of a final  disposal  facility  for the radioactive  waste,  hazardous  waste,  or 
mixed waste;  
 
b. the intended  use of the site and components  (e.g.,  Will the site be released  for 
unrestricted or restricted use?) ; 
 
c. the site characteristics  (e.g.,  demography,  accessibility,  meteorology) ; 
 
d. the cost‐benefit  analysis  (CBA)  results ; and 
 
e. the resource  considerations.  
 
10.5.3.5  Decommissioning  Operations  
 
Decommissioning operations  shall be conducted  according to the approved  decommissioning 
project plan. Significant deviations from the decommissioning project plan should be approved by the responsible field organization in consultation with the appropriate program 
office.  
 
During decommissioning operations, remediation control surveys (Berger 1992) should be 
conducted to guide the cleanup in the real‐time mode. This will ensure that the 
decommissioning workers, the public, and the environment are all adequately protected 
against exposures  to radiation  and radioactive  materials  arising  from  the decommissioning 
activities.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
213  
  
The volume of waste and the associated cost of decommissioning the waste will be greatly 
reduced  if equipment  can be cleaned  up and disposed  of as either  non‐radioactive  waste  or as 
non‐TRU waste. Numerous techniques have been developed for decontamination of 
equipment and materials. Established techniques and the latest technology should be 
considered in minimizing the quantity of contaminated equipment that requires disposal and 
the waste generated from the decontamination processes. These techniques are described in 
Section 10.4.2.  
 
In establishing  a radiological control  program  for decommissioning operations,  the scope  of 
the decommissioning effort should be identified. Factors to be considered in program development include:  
 
a. the type  of facility  or land  area  to be cleaned  up; 
 
b. the type  and amount  of radioactive  contaminated  material,  hazardous  waste,  and 
mixed waste;  
 
c. the radiological and hazardous  material cleanup  levels ; and 
 
d. the decommissioning methods  being used.  
 
The extent of the radiological control program will depend on the selected decommissioning alternative. For the SAFSTOR alternative, the radiological control program would be minimal 
following  deactivation  (i.e.,  surveillance  activities)  until  the decontamination  phase  is initiated, 
at which time a full radiological control program would be necessary. For the DECON alternative, a fully staffed radiological control program would be needed from the start of 
decontamination. Typically, this program would be si milar to the program conducted during 
normal operations. Entombment is not a viable alternative for decommissioning of uranium‐ 
contaminated facilities.  
 
Also, the hazardous and radioactive contaminants present and the specific decontamination 
techniques (e.g., mechanical methods, high‐pressure water, abrasive cleaning, vibratory 
finishing, ultrasonics, electro‐polishing, decontamination foams, strippable decontamination coatings,  and dry ice blasting)  used  by each  alternative  will affect  the extent of the radiological 
control program. For example, if an abrasive mechanical technique for decontaminating equipment (where airborne concentrations may be a concern) is chosen over just scrapping 
the equipment as waste, obviously the radiological control program w ill need to be more 
sophisticated.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
214  
 10.5.4  Post‐Decommissioning  Activities  
 
A final radiological  and chemical  survey report  (or an independent verification  survey  report) 
and a project  final report  should  be prepared.  The final report  should  include  a description  of 
the project, the final status of the property, and the lessons learned from the project.  
 
As defined  in Berger  (1992),  confirmatory  surveys  may  be performed  by the regulatory  agency 
to confirm the adequacy of the contractor’s final radiological and chemical survey report. A 
confirmatory survey typically addresses from 1% to 10% of the site.  
 
The responsible program organization should ensure any necessary long‐term maintenance and surveillance or other safety controls are provided for the decommissioned property. The 
decommissioned property may be released from DOE ownership if the responsible  program 
organization, in consultation with the Office of the  Environment, Health,  Safety  and Security  
(EHSS ‐1) certifies  that the property  meets  applicable  release  criteria for residual radioactivity  
and hazardous  chemicals.  If appropriate  release  criteri a are not met, the property may be 
reused for other program activities that may or may not involve radioactive or hazardous 
materials, provided a conversion method leading to reuse is described (DOE M 435.1‐1).  
 
10.5.5  Quality  Assurance  
 
Decommissioning activities shall be conducted according to the applicable requirements of  
the ANSI/ASME NQA‐1, Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications  
(2022b ) and other  appropriate  national consensus  standards  (e.g.,  EPA guidance  documents  in 
the EPA QA/R and EPA QA/G series should be used in the design of environmental monitoring 
programs). The quality assurance program for decommissioning activities should follow the 
guidelines in DOE Order 414.1D  Chg 2 , Quality Assurance ( 2020d ). 
 
10.6 Decontamination and Decommissioning  Experience 
 
Discussions of decommissioning activities at several uranium facilities can be found in 
Adkisson (1987) and Wynveen et al. (1982). Decommissioning activities took place in several 
types  of uranium  facilities including an  enriched  uranium  fuel fabrication plant,  a mixed  oxide 
(Pu/U)  fuel fabrication  and development  plant,  a research  and development  laboratory,  and a 
depleted  uranium manufacturing  plant. Equipment  decontaminated, dismantled,  or removed 
included glove boxes, fume hoods, laboratory equipment, piping, ventilation ducts, uranium 
and thorium sediments from a settling lagoon, and soil from a small shallow burial area.  
Decontamination  techniques  included  wiping with  a damp  cloth,  strippable  paint,  acid wash, 
and removal of soil and sediments. Some lessons learned from these decommissioning 
operations included the following:  
 
a. Waste  management  planning should  begin  early  in the decommissioning planning  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
215  
 stages  and account  for the possibility  there may  be more  stringent  regulations  for 
shipping hazardous or radioactive wastes than disposing of it. Any waste package 
designs need to be reviewed to ensure compliance with all applicable waste 
management requirements.  
 
b. Temporary contamination enclosures  are effective  in controlling contamination  during 
size reduction  of large  equipment  such  as glove  boxes.  Any loose  contamination  on the 
equipment should be fixed prior to placing it in the enclosure.  
 
1. Criticality  safety  issues  should  be considered  regarding  the geometry  of any waste 
material containing fissile material.  
 
2. Decommissioning operations  must  be prepared  for changes  in regulatory  criteria 
and implementation of these new criteria.  
 
3. During decommissioning operations,  personnel  need  to recognize  the possibility  of 
encountering elevated  levels  of contamination  in unexpected  locations  such  as the 
excavations for concrete structures or under existing roofing or flooring.  
 
4. It is necessary to establish and document criteria for implementing regulations in 
accordance  with  10 CFR § 835.101.  For example,  in meeting  surface  contamination 
guidelines, it is important to establish the acceptable detection efficiency of the detector and areas for averaging measurements.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017

Department of Energy site: Either a tract owned by DOE or a tract leased or otherwise made available  
to the Federal Government under terms that afford to the Department of Energy rights of access and control  substantially  equal  to those  that the Department  of Energy  would  possess  if it were  the holder  of 
the fee (or pertinent interest therein) as agent of and on behalf of the Government.  One or more DOE 
operations/program activities are carried out within the boundaries of the described tract.  DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
B ‐ 2  
  
detector: A device or component designed to produce a quantifiable response to ionizing radiation, 
normally  measured  electronically.  (Portable  Monitoring  Instrument  Calibration  Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐ 
1C) 
 
DOELAP: The Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program defines a set of reference 
performance tests and provides a description of the minimum levels of acceptable performance for 
personnel  dosimetry  systems  and radiobioassay  programs  under  DOE‐STD‐1111‐ 2018 (2018a ). (External 
Dosimetry Program Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
exposure:  The general condition  of being subjected  to ionizing radiation,  such  as by exposure  to ionizing 
radiation from external sources or to ionizing radiation sources inside the body. In this document, 
exposure does not refer to the radiological physics concept of charge liberated per unit mass of air. 
(Internal Dosimetry Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
fixed  contamination: Radioactive  material that has been  deposited  onto  a surface  and cannot  be readily 
removed by nondestructive means, such as casual contact, wiping, brushing, or laundering. Fixed contamination does not include radioactive material that is present in a matrix, such as soil or cement, 
or radioactive material that has been induced in a material through activation processes.  (DOE‐STD‐ 
1098)  
 
fixed‐location  sampler:  An air sampler located  at a fixed  location  in the workplace.  
 
grab sampling: A single  sample  removed  from  the workplace  air over  a short  time  interval,  typically  less 
than 1 hour.  
 
high‐efficiency  particulate  air (HEPA)  filter:  Throwaway  extended  pleated  medium  dry‐type  filter with  
1) a rigid casing enclosing the full depth of the pleats, 2) a minimum particle removal efficiency of 
99.97%  for thermally  generated  monodisperse  di‐octyl  phlalate  smoke  particles  with  a diameter  of 0.3 
µm, and 3) a maximum pressure drop of 1.0‐in. w.g. when clean and operated at its rated airflow 
capacity. (DOE‐STD‐1098).  
 
intake: The amount  of radionuclide  taken  into the body  by inhalation,  absorption  through  intact  skin, 
injection, ingestion, or through wounds. Depending on the radionuclide involved, intakes may be 
reported  in units  of mass  (e.g.,  µg, mg), activity (e.g., µCi,  Bq), or potential  alpha  energy  (e.g.,  MeV,  J) 
units. (Internal Dosimetry Program Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
minimum detectable  amount/activity (MDA): The smallest  amount  (activity  or mass)  of an analyte  in a 
sample that will be detected  with a  probability, B, of non‐detection (Type II error) while accepting a 
probability,  α, of erroneously deciding that a positive(non‐zero) quantity of analyte is present in an 
appropriate blank (Type I error). The MDA is computed using the same value of  α as used for the 
decision level (DL). The MDA depends on both  α and β . Measurement results  are compared  to the DL, DOE‐STD‐1136‐2017  
B ‐ 3  
 not the MDA; the MDA  is used  to determine  whether  a program  has adequate  detection  capability.  The 
MDA will be greater than or equal to the DL. (Internal Dosimetry Program Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
personal  air monitoring:  A form  of breathing zone  air monitoring that involves  the sampling of air in the 
immediate vicinity (typically within one foot) of an individual’s nose and mouth, usually by a portable 
sampling pump and collection tube (e.g., a lapel sampler)  worn on the body. (Air Monitoring Chapter of 
DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
portable  air sampler: An air sampler  designed  to be moved  from  area to area.  
 
radiation‐generating device (RDG): The collective term for devices which produce ionizing radiation, 
including certain sealed radioactive sources, small particle accelerators used for single purpose applications  which  produce  ionizing radiation  (e.g.,  radiography),  and electron‐generating  devices  that 
produce x‐rays incidentally. (Radiation‐Generating Devices Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
radioactive material: Any material that spontaneously emits ionizing radiation (e.g., X‐ or gamma rays, alpha or beta particles, neutrons). The term “radioactive material” also includes materials onto which 
radioactive material is deposited or into which it is incorporated. For purposes of practicality, both 10 
CFR Part 835 and this Standard establish certain threshold levels below which specified actions, such as posting, labeling, or individual monitoring, are not required. These threshold levels are usually expressed  in terms  of total  activity  or concentration,  contamination  levels,  individual  doses,  or exposure 
rates. (DOE‐STD‐1098)  
 
radiological work permit (RWP): The permit that identifies radiological conditions, establishes worker protection  and monitoring  requirements,  and contains  specific  approvals  for radiological work  activities. 
The Radiological Work Permit serves as an administrative process for planning and controlling 
radiological work and informing the worker of the radiological conditions.  (DOE‐STD‐1098)  
 
radiological  control  organization: An organization  responsible  for radiation  protection.  (Sealed 
Radioactive Source Accountability and Control Chapter of DOE G 441.1‐1C)  
 
real‐time  air monitoring:  Collection  and real‐time  analysis  of the workplace  atmosphere  using 
continuous air monitors (CAMs).

B ‐ 4  
 representative  air sampling:  The sampling of airborne  radioactive  material in a manner  such  that the 
sample collected closely approximates both the amount of activity and the physical and chemical 
properties (e.g., particle size and solubility) of the aerosol to which the workers may be exposed.  
 
source‐specific  air sampling: Collection  of an air sample  near  an actual  or likely  release  point  in a work 
area using fixed‐location samplers or portable air samplers.  
 
survey: An evaluation of the radiological conditions and potential hazards incident to the production, 
use, transfer,  release,  disposal,  or presence  of radioactive  material or other  sources  of radiation.  When 
appropriate, such an evaluation includes a physical survey of the location of radioactive material and 
measurements or calculations of levels of radiation, or concentrations or quantities of radioactive 
material present. (DOE‐STD‐1098)  
 
workplace  monitoring:  The measurement of radioactive  material and/or  direct  radiation  levels  in areas 
that could be routinely occupied by workers.
